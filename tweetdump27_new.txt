ICAC special @qanda #qanda
Does anyone want to hear my new social media concept? It's basically Twitter combined with Qanda combined with Tinder. I call it #taquindr
The #QandA intro looks like the Terminator is targeting audience members.
#QandA time!!!
Ok. Now I'm sufficiently ragey #qanda
None too soon Dutton....poll driven coward ! #qanda
The new titles still remind me of The Chaser's War on Everything #qanda

Don't know why, but I'm giving #qanda another go. Let me put my mouth guard for teeth grinding in first though.
Tanya Plibersek for PM. #QandA
#QandA Why hasn't Andrew Bolt been sacked by now? #doublestandards
My tweet game is going to be on point for tonight's #qanda
I am accidentally watching #qanda fuck
How does Tanya feel about being preferred Labor leader in the polls now? #QandA @QandA
#qanda Please donate as much as you can to help the people of #Nepal. #NepalEarthquake
Who the hell is Bruce Jenner? #qanda @QandA
Insisted on watching #QandA tonight so I can show bf the woman I would like to run the country one day aka Tanya Pilbersek *nods*
For Tom Porteous - is this the most anti-human rights government this country has ever had? @QandA #QandA
Can someone ask Arthur about AWH @QandA #QandA
"Not that I recall" ARFA? Next week on #qanda - the ghost of Christopher Skase.
#QandA hope I get a tweet on tonight
Sinodinos is a brave man getting on #qanda
What does the panel think about the fact that Robb was asked no questions about the TPP last week @qanda
Are you watching @QandA @thebeckett44 ?
@qanda Tanya will the shoppies get rolled at Nat conference on gay marriage?
Will unwarranted deaths be the theme for tonight's #qanda ?
Lest we disrespect #qanda
Tuen on #qanda and learn something!
#qanda balanced panel ?
#qanda offenseive Anzac tweets have quite rightly been the end of a silly man's career
Ermagerd finally catching #Qanda in the same time zone #bam
I reckon Tanya Plibersek has a busy night ahead of her on #qanda - what, with #marriagequality #Nepal #Bali9 and #ALPLeadership #auspol
Hopefully my tweets tonight don't get me fired #qanda
#qanda http://t.co/LGaaoHOoXB
love me a bit of @tanya_plibersek #QandA
Tanya's time to shine #QandA
Tanya's going to say something on the mic for equality. Can't wait to hear it #qanda
#qanda 4-2
#tonyjonesisababe #qanda
Did someone say "human rights"? Careful, that might be illegal under the new antiterror legislation #qanda
I think me, during #qanda is similar to listening to @CuriouserThanU yelling at people whilst playing Dota2 - fun times.
#qanda let's go
Monday night and it starts again. How much #qanda can I take before I turn it off?
"Execution" - a euphemism for state-sanctioned murder. #qanda
Fingers hovering over the keyboard... #QandA
Can we have an episode WITHOUT a politician? @QandA #QandA
@QandA #qanda @TonyAbbottMHR MY FRIENDS MUM MISSING IN LANGTANG PLEASE HELP HER &amp; ORHER AUSTRALIANS UNACCOUNTED FOR, PLEASE PM ABBOTT
#qanda no point asking Arfa a question he won't remember
@QandA how can we save the lives of Andrew and Myuran? #Bali9
Wow, if this is true its fantastic!!! #qanda  https://t.co/BChf3ZpvEU
It's more like Q and AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA #QandA @QandA
Send to Indonesian ambassador home #qanda
No crime warrants the death penalty. #QandA
@QandA - Question for Sinodinos: Why are you so fucking corrupt you snivelling little turd ? #qanda
Should have had Tim Wilson on with Tom Porteous #QandA
Sack holbrook now! #qanda
My comment: the three people on the left of the panel suck #qanda
Wonder if Sinodinos will be more forthcoming in answering questions here than he was at ICAC. #qanda
I hope Arthur Sinodinis remembers this #qanda experience tomorrow
It's pre-meditated murder by the state. It reduces that government &amp; brutalises us all. #QandA
Topic: spill motion failure #QandA
Capital punishment achieves one thing: it turns a nation into a serial killer.  #qanda
switched channels right after first question on #qanda
Don't Forget everyone, http://t.co/yJrvfHNhSv if you want to tell Joe Hockey not to screw up this years budget! #QandA #AusPol
Hey #qanda https://t.co/pxUkaWFZJO
Oh no.. Not Arthur. I thought he was condemned to exile in the realms of political irrelevance. #QandA
#QandA or #GoT? What will the pirate lefties choose tonight?
Ooh, look, Arfur's taken his snout out of the trough long enough to appear on #qanda @qanda
Everyone will be tweeting carefully tonight. #qanda
Is it to soon to start the hashtag #plibsforpm #qanda @tanya_plibersek
Ummmm, what about #NepalEarthquake ? @QandA
Isn't #QandA aware of the breaking news?
I deplore illegal drugs but I deplore even more capital punishment #qanda
Are you kidding Indo justice system #qanda
#qanda yes it is appalling we all condemn the executions let's move on
#qanda we don't celebrate ANZAC day Tony, we commemorate!
send in the boys #qanda
Now remember children, be careful when crossing the tweet. #QandA #WatchWhatYouSay @QandA
Aaah, the #7others #qanda
We're lucky we live in a judicial system with minimal corruption #qanda @qanda
So tired but @tanya_plibersek is on #qanda so I'm gonna try and hang in there!! Love the Plibs!!
#Bali9 mercy in short supply #qanda
How can Indonesia ignore these serious allegations? #qanda
#QandA BREAKING NEWS THOUGH @AuskarSurbakti
Andrew and Myuran don't deserve to die for their crime. No-one does. #IStandForMercy. #qanda
Taking a life is never ok #qanda
Such a tragic loss of life should not be tolerated by our government. #qanda
How does this info release so late? @QandA #QandA
Ha! Arty Shonkydinis should be behind bars let alone still suckling from the public purse. #Disgrace #QandA #Auspol
Get off the Bali 9 train, over it! #qanda
I encourage Scott Mcinytre  @mcintinhos to tweet questions at the #qanda panel @qanda tonight
@QandA #qanda marry me @tanya_plibersek
Death is not the answer, especially when politics is involved #qanda
@qanda any chance of adressing refugees? #qanda
These accusations needed to be investigated long ago, when they occurred. Now is too late. #qanda
#qanda Equality? Where were you when all the others were being executed?
#QandA send in the sas
This is state-sanctioned murder. Period. #qanda
She wrote a book criticising ANZAC. Surely a few obnoxious tweets is a far better way of putting your case forward. #qanda
No one should ever have to go to bed knowing they'll likely be executed the following day.  #QandA
#Qanda time.
Good riddance to bad rubbish #Bali9 #qanda
How long have we known about these bribery allegations? #qanda
#QandA @TheRealPBarry Paul Barry just said it best: freedom of speech protects you from being jailed not from trashing your employment.
JUST DO SOMETHING! #qanda
So historian on #QandA an #ANZAC basher. Why am I not surprised? #theirABC
Why do governments let their own citizens kill helpless people? #QandA
#qanda old news wrong...case to be heard 12 May #bali9
OR we could focus on some other people dying? Nepal... Syria.. #Qanda #ujcomm2657
Stay in execution on legal grounds just announced by #Bali9 lawyer #qanda
I got Twitter 3 years ago with the sole purpose of getting on #qanda. Throw a dog a bone!!!!
We don't control Indonesia. It is a bad situation but there are limits to what Australia can do.  #qanda
#qanda three words Bali bombers clemency
"Trusted" Howard Chief-of-Staff, Sir Rush Donations. Trusted by whom? Has he got his memory back since #ICAC #auspol #qanda
She should take it up with the Indonesian judiciary. It'll cost about $130k. #qanda
#qanda time. If this discusses anything other than the #Bali9 and "Anzac Twittergate," I'll be stunned. #auspol
Don't Forget everyone, http://t.co/yJrvfHNhSv  if you want to tell @JoeHockey not to screw up this year's budget! #QandA #AusPol
They knew what they were doing. Were fully prepared to profit so should be fully prepared to suffer the consequences #qanda
I would support pulling our ambassador to Indonesia if the executions go ahead #qanda
#qanda @QandA  do the crime , do the time
If no one questions Sinodinos' credibility following his #ICAC testimony, then tonight is a waste. #qanda
Bali is corrupt, this is not new news... #QandA
The bribes don't make a difference to what the crime was. However if true, the bribe allegations are deplorable #qanda
#qanda Nobody deserves to die...either in Indonesia, Australia, or anywhere else.
@QandA ceasing aid to Indonesia will not save these men and hurt others many times over
It seems money can be the real difference between life and death, in some poorer nations, with the death penalty! #qanda
Killing is wrong. Full stop. A state organizing a death is disgusting. #qanda
"When law and diplomacy have failed". Law has prevailed #qanda
Capital Punishment should NEVER be an option of punishment.. it's barabric #qanda @QandA
The death penalty may temporarily satisfy our thirst for vengeance but it does not deliver justice. #QandA
Arfur Sinodinos doesn't see anything wrong with incentive payments #qanda
#qanda @qanda Tanya will the shoppies get rolled at Nat conference on gay marriage?
Tanya Plibersek is on. Time for a display of intelligence #qanda
#QandA News that another appeal scheduled for May 12
https://t.co/kf9dfRXirP #qanda
Michael Biehn and squad from The Rock #qanda
@Kate_McClymont should have been on #QandA with Arfur.
Julie Bishop has done an excellent job attempting to secure clemency. But the Prime Minister? Not so much. #qanda
Well. If the #Bali9 appeal stories are true, they've been granted an appeal on the 12th of May  #qanda @QandA
Death penalty doesn't work... #qanda
We'll take that as a speech #Qanda
@QandA Wonder how much the Vatican are donating to the affected people of Nepal? #qanda
There is something more going on behind the scenes in Indonesia than we realise #qanda
#qanda still no greens in the Mix, how many MP's does a Green party have to get before they are recognised as a third &amp; viable alternative?
@QandA this is a bipartisan issue.
In NZ missing #QandA although is it really missing because I'm in the future
These guys knew the risks....let em collect the consequences #qanda
Withdraw our aid so that Tony Abbott can have a conversation with the Indonesian president. $605m in aid given to them in 2015 #qanda
#qanda RT @AuskarSurbakti BREAKING Chan &amp; Sukumaran's lawyer Arpan says Indonesia's Constitutional Court will hear latest appeal May 12
So this capital punishment, how many murders has it stopped? #qanda
Fucking hell. Just fucking kill them already. Sheesh #qanda There are more important things going on in the world than this #qanda
Nationalism is the reason why Jokowi is holding fast on death penalty. Let's get rid of it #QandA
Heroin is a killer drug so I feel no sympathy for two drug traffickers who will die by Wednesday #qanda
It's all about Indonesian politics now #qanda
#qanda could diplomatic immunity save them?
#qanda if executions worked Indonesia would be drug free now
#qanda Injustice is selling junk to those people who would gladly face the firing squad without it.
I imagine that diplomacy doesn't always get played out in front of the media #qanda
@QandA @narelleford: What does the panel think about the fact that Robb was asked no questions about the TPP last week #qanda
State sanctioned murder is still murder! #qanda
I don't give a stuff about drug trafficking ring leaders. Next question, please! #qanda
@QandA we need to do everything and anything to save our fellow Australians lives. #qanda
It feels hopeless at this point #QandA
. @WickBurner Don't worry,  he won't remember any answers. #qanda
"@AuskarSurbakti: BREAKING: Chan &amp; Sukumaran's lawyer says Indonesia's Constitutional Court will hear their latest appeal on May 12" #qanda
Commit the crime, so the time... #qanda @QandA
we need to stop telling other countries how to rule their own people #qanda @qanda
#qanda a life is worth more that the law that wants to exterminate against all reason.
#qanda Tom Fischer continues roaming the world courtesy us taxpayers!
Community sentiment shift = vote shift #qanda
First question. Is that dude related to Shane Porteous from A Country Practice? #QandA
Breaking news #qanda Indonesia have slated hearing for May 12
"There is no justice in this world" -Littlefinger #GoT #qanda
#Qanda anyone trust a word the corrupt Arthur $inodeni$ says? I don't
=====) #qanda
Ceasing aid to Indonesia is not a sound move   And punishes those who have nothing to do with this decision #qanda
#QandA there is no justice in indo
Sinodinis' motivation for appearing on #QandA is opaque to me
Money != justice #QandA
No $560mill a year in aid for you #Indonesia #qanda
Shoulda called Saul  #qanda
Nobody likes a neighbour who kills #qanda
Would Tony face the squad for smuggling those budgies? #qanda
So what's Arthur been up to lately? #qanda #timeonhishands
Their journey that led to rehabilitation  #QandA
Are you JokoWidodoing me? It's barbaric and disgusting. @QandA #QandA
I lasted through the first question on #qanda and that was it. Judging it early and switching off
#qanda I'm so over this issue, they pedaled drugs that could have killed my kids
We should've acted sooner. Shame on Howard, Rudd &amp; Gillard for not acting sooner #qanda @qanda
Kill the death penalty #QandA @QandA
australia is a nation built on reformation #QandA
#qanda show mercy
Call me parochial, but it's never too soon to call #qanda has just been 'won' by @tanya_plibersek
10 years ago Indonesia would have killed drug dealers. Now they're killing reformed good men #Qanda
i feel for both families of myuran sukumaran and andrew chan #IStandForMercy #qanda
#QandA previously I was in 2 minds on death penalty. Now I know, no one should die for crime. Shot in the head??? Does not compute.
@qanda The default sentence was death. That's what will happen!
#QandA this week appearing Arthur Sinodinos, next week Eddie Obeid
I think Australia has vastly underestimated Indonesia's capacity to dig it's heels in. This is a statement. #qanda
How can Indonesia fight so hard against the execution of their own citizens, execute others, and expect to be taken seriously? #QandA
You don't murder the rehabilitated. #qanda
Imagine if the AFP had arrested the Bali 9 not just dobbed them in #QandA
Sinodinos misunderstood Australian sentiment? Maybe our PM has too #qanda
@QandA  what is stopping Australia from giving andrew and myu diplomatic immunity to save their lives?
Strapped by someone to a plank and shooting then is abhorrent. It's nothing but state sanctioned murder. #qanda
I wish we could dedicate as much time to the women affected by domestic violence each year as much as we've dedicated the Bali 9 #qanda
We have an #ActuallyAutistic former politician Tim Fischer on #QandA tonight!
A life is priceless - worth more than $130000 #qanda
There is no place in any civilised society for state sanctioned murder. We have to do more @QandA #qanda
@PolitIncAussie so, go shout "SMASH THE TROTS!" in your weedy little undergrad voice #qanda
It's not Australia - you can't expect their law to work like ours #qanda @QandA
I oppose the death penalty in all forms for all crimes #qanda
It's cruel to rehabilitate prisoners only to kill them. #qanda
#qanda https://t.co/khZEFaf7ZK
We need to step up pressure on Indonesia. #qanda
The death penalty is very barbaric to have in this day and age #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Senator Sinodinos giving his opinion regarding integrity. #QandA
If an individual or a nation kills, it's still just wrong. #qanda
#QandA the rule of law cannot be upheld when decisions are based on policy!
Tanya, my Tanya. Once again you'll make #qanda worth the frustration.
Any country can execute drug smugglers. But it takes a real leader to pardon rehabilitated individuals. #QandA
@qanda #qanda. Drug smugglers are human beings too
@qanda Tim Fischer, when are we going to finally get great rail infrastructure, high speed passenger and inland freight?
sadly making them human and high profile makes them better candidates for deterrence. #qanda
#qanda indo treats drug crims like #auspol treats refugees
Nationalism enviably ends in murder #Qanda
Correct wording is that we commemorate ANZAC Day, NOT celebrate!!! #QandA #getitright
What does it say of a judicial system if it is not grounded in principles of rehabilitation and redemption? #QandA
Killing people is never ok #qanda
This drawn out saga is a muscle flex from a dangerous state #qanda #EnoughIsEnough
Sinodinos saying he and his party were out of touch with something within the community? #ShockHorror #qanda
#qanda Why did you not do all you could for the others?
#QandA @QandA Reformed men mean nothing to #Jokowi. Australia must cease ALL trade, assistance and even flights to anywhere in Indonesia!
So is Arthur corrupt or not? #QandA
@QandA #qanda is mercy an ANZAC quality? I'd say so...,
Somewhat hypocritical when the Indonesians are fighting for their own on death row abroad @QandA #qanda
#qanda https://t.co/xopfFAjZep
@qanda ... i feel sick that these boys will be shot dead #qanda
@qanda shouldn't the two in question abide by the law of the nation they travel?
I'd rather they weren't killed. But I'd prefer my life long friend didn't kill herself on heroin #qanda
@QandA what's the point of rehabilitation .. Boycott Indonesia and stop the aid
#qanda Imprisonment by the state for no crime - for asking for help is also barbaric.Refugees.
Indonesian drug smugglers getting good representation on #QandA At least 2nd or 3rd personal connection using platform over the last month.
It's not about "community sentiment" - it's about common human decency. Don't kill those people, please! #qanda
Excited to get back into #qanda tonight! Interesting topics tonight! #ujcomm2657
Hasn't the execution been delayed for a last ditch appeal? #qanda
#QandA  insult our heroes gets sacked: insult Mohammed, get your head chopped off or get blown up.
It's not our place to dictate the laws of another country #qanda
The AFP should never have handed them over. #qanda
Where are the vigils and public conversation about Indonesia's brutal occupation of West Papua!! Not just their capital punishment #qanda
It's a #qanda kinda night
Judges putting $130k on two lives. Disgusting. #QandA
It's an difficult situation. We could get on our knees and beg and I don't think it would make a difference. They will die. #qanda
Chan and Sukumaran are shaping up to be two modern day ANZACS #qanda
Congratulations Andrew and Feeby Chan. #IStandForMercy  #qanda @QandA
They have changed. Time has moved on. They should be forgiven, not killed. #qanda
Offer a swap for Adrian Bayley? #qanda
So many died at the hands of nature this week, now more will die at the hands of man #ujcomm2657 #qanda
#qanda Human rights should always come first. #showmercy
Yes!!! Made it onto #qanda again!
It's such a sad situation #qanda #bali9
#QandA @QandA https://t.co/igeRofPUmF
Why do we care more for the human rights of drug smugglers than refugees who seek our help? #qanda
Abbott's navy invaded Indo waters numerous times &amp; now its payback time #qanda
Going from #mkr to #qanda does funky (not in the good way) things to my brain
#qanda the only upside of this awful situation is how Australia has shown it's compassionate side. Now, let's encourage that instinct.
"Trusted" Howard Chief-of-Staff, Sir Rush Donation. Trusted by whom? Has he got his memory back since #ICAC #auspol #qanda
People need to be better educated about ANZAC and what it really means @QandA #qanda
Really think #QandA deserves to be a verb. Like, "Monday night &amp; ready to #QandA." @QandA
@QandA there is news in about bali9 https://t.co/HJiDFK8dpw
It doesn't matter the circumstances, taking a life as punishment is never okay #qanda
Have they really been rehabilitated or have they just done it to try and avoid execution #qanda
#qanda Martin Bryant wouldn't have deserved the death penalty?
#qanda how can we stop these murders?
Corruption in Indonesia does not surprise me. The fact that lives are at stake is unfortunate. #QandA
Wasn't joko widodo meant to rid Indonesia of corruption? Looks like he's really succeeded on that front . . . #QandA
Indonesia is corrupt as hell. This is no secret. @QandA #QandA
We should also look at the facts, not just the stories of criminals #QandA
"Rehabilitation" is the most popular escape plan for reoffenders #qanda
@QandA #QandA I'm sorry the people on your panel can't save Chan and Sukumaran
Anyone who thinks any Oz government will do anything other than slap the Indos on the wrist hasn't been watching closely enough.  #QandA
Stop aid to Indonesia. Don't fund those who would be perfectly happy to kill our own citizens #auspol #qanda
Indonesia just tough on border security. Australia sends 5 year old girls to be abused on #Nauru as "disincentive"... #qanda
#qanda They spent ten years waiting for their sentence to be heard correctly: justice delayed is justice denied.
Arthur's right hand seems to know what his left hand is doing. Makes a nice change.  #QandA
@QandA @cooktragic  We commemorate ANZAC Day we don't celebrate the loss of over 8,000 Australians.  To celebrate means to jump for joy!!
If they are killed then the Indonesian government has wasted 10 years on rehabilitating them its a waste of money for Indonesia @QandA
The help these two men offered other criminals will not necessarily be replaced by others, this could result in more crime in future! #qanda
It is NOT an act of weakness to stop this. #qanda #bali9
Sinodinos is a leading authority on corruption. #qanda
#QandA we can't protect our own inmates like Carl Williams being murdered, forget Indonesia
The death penalty has been proven to be ineffective in reducing instances of drug trafficking. #qanda
The prison system is supposed to rehabilitate. #qanda
Not giving clemency does not justify stopping aid. Do not punish the people of Indonesia for the structure of their laws. #QandA
#qanda any water or ICAC question?
Wait so you need the Community to tell you what is morally right Arthur? #qanda
Ive run out of new ways to say that the death penalty is state sanctioned murder #qanda #auspol #deathpenalty
@QandA #qanda its extremely deplorable by Indonesia executing the #bali9 without properly exhausting all avenues
Andrew and Myuran are being executed in order to burnish Jokowi's law and order credentials. #QandA
The outpouring of concern in Australia is equal to the outpouring of concern Indonesians have about drugs. #QandA
IT's been well established that #qanda is just Jerry Springer for inner city types. https://t.co/K3ExIxBU1Q
Why is the ABC program description saying Sinodinos is Assistant Treasurer? Remember when he resigned in shame? #QandA
Arthur sinidonis underestimated our capacity for compassion... There lies the Liberals dark problem #qanda @QandA
Bali pair doomed by powerful forces pulling weak Joko's strings. Nothing will save them. #qanda
@QandA Make the death penalty illegal in international law for all time!
#ArthurSinodinos the Arthur Daly of Oz #qanda
Domestic politics in any country can be brutal #qanda
Australian authorities should never have handed the Bali 9 to Indonesia in the first place #qanda
why don't we raise the same questions and awareness of rapists and murderers; why are they not on death row #qanda @qanda
It's horrible when a judge just won't stay bribed. #qanda
#qanda so countries withdrew their ambassadors. How has that impacted on Indonesia's position? Zilch. There you go.
Everyone saying 'Blame Indonesia' instead of 'Blame Widodo' should consider if they feel responsible for Tony Abbott. #qanda
#qanda Lol  https://t.co/dFanqughbJ
I'm sure having a roundtable discussion will save the lives of two men halfway across the world. #qanda
Who's paying for Sinodinos's opinion tonight? #ForSale #qanda
Disgusting that the Indonesians announced last 72 hours on ANZAC day #qanda
Is this a good time to remember that our supposed "allies" in Saudi Arabia still publicly beheads people? #qanda
The modern world has evolved beyond the death penalty - does Indonesia want to be a part of it? #qanda
They've made the coffins and the crosses - not much hope left... #qanda
Can't believe qanda is doing a whole episode devoted to Manny Pacquiao vs. Floyd Mayweather.
@QandA What about the lives of asylum seekers???? What's the difference????
Too little, too late #qanda
@QandA is it time to consider a binding position or a conscience vote on same sex marriage QandA
Have we all forgotten the complicity of the AFP? #qanda
@Jacksimpson32 @QandA ummm nope, should I be?
The death penalty is one thing. Corruption within Indonesian judiciary and politics is extremely worrying.   #QandA
Australia embarrasses itself in melding repeatedly in another sovereign nations affairs #qanda
I wonder how many bribery offers these two men faced along their journey? #corruption #QandA #ujcomm2657
Arty Shonkydinis could always 'raise funds' to get himself out of a Bali prison. #QandA #Auspol
No Australian government is going to jeopardise the relationship with Indonesia for 2 men #qanda
@QandA if u are such a close friend, you should had stopped them.
The UN Declaration states everyone has a "right to life". End of debate #qanda
Life in Indonesia can be bought for a price ... this gives the president reason to show mercy #qanda
The Indonesians should want until all inquiries into the sentencing process have been exhausted. #qanda
I'm hoping that someone asks Tanya about the latest Morgan poll... #QandA
Perhaps Australians should not deal drugs in Indonesia #qanda
Can we just not kill people ever. Regardless of what crime they committed #QandA
Everyone needs to stop going to Indonesia they only want our money they have no respect #qanda
@QandA To see animals go to the zoo. To see monkeys go to Indonesia #qanda
We need to increase the pressure on Indonesia. #qanda
#QandA cut all aid to indo
Isn't it un-Australian to avoid a field of bullets? #qanda
Tim's looking at Arthur like "Mr Howard, is that you?!" #qanda
#qanda Lest we let two of our citizens die...
Sinodinis "it's harder to kill people you know something about" #QandA
Strapping someone to a plank and shooting them is abhorrent. This is nothing but state sanctioned murder. #qanda
I guess whatever the outcome is with Chan and Sukumaran, it's a sad day for humanity. #QandA
Australians should #boycottbali #boycottindonesia #qanda
Indonesia. It's the money or the gun. #qanda
Once they're executed, it can't be reversed. The punishment doesn't fit the crime. #qanda
#qanda Shame Q&amp;A Shame, how can you promote Arthur Sinodinos by having him on the show in light of the NSW ICAC findings? #auspol #nswpol
IT'S TIME! #qanda #marriageequality http://t.co/y1rM2nxcm5 http://t.co/YL7jinOMQ3
@QandA There are so many people dying everyday what makes these two more important than all the perils faced by undeserving innocent.
wow #qanda
Sounds almost as if Sinodinos has focus-grouped these killings. #qanda
Fully support pulling out our ambassador to Indonesia if executions go ahead- our govt must do something! #qanda
I do feel sorry for the family @QandA #QandA
#QandA Brisbane rally to #KeepHopeAlive King George Square 6-7pm Tuesday #IStandForMercy
Why have claims of judicial corruption only emerged now. So who is lying #qanda
With a corrupt judicial process, how can we trust any legal appeals? #qanda
Are potential drug smugglers learning anything from this scenario? #QandA
Execution as a form of deterrent is fundamentally flawed and in need of urgent review. #qanda  #ujcomm2657
So we were asking Aceh for their tsunami money back so that we could raise enough funds for a bribe? #qanda
Oh oh oh #qanda
#qanda Indonesia only cares about our foreign aid and fleecing tourists
#qanda The death sentence is the hallmark of a barbaric society.
Breaking news on #qanda
#qanda its easy to repent when you get cought..
It's not a penalty. It's Murder. #qanda
#qanda great tragedy all round, but a good lesson for my children, drug kill!
Abbott is more worried about the economic implications with Indonesia and their threats re. asylum seekers than the lives of two men #qanda
Don't like how another country rules its laws...DONT go to their country and BREAK their laws!!! #QandA
If the bribery allegation was substantiated then it would have been addressed at some point in the last 10 years. #qanda
Death penalty is wrong, but let's not pretend this would be happening if it was Aussies on America's death row. #qanda
@QandA Shick-shick-BANG!
"Trusted" Howard Chief-of-Staff, Sir Rush Donation. Trusted by whom? Has he got his memory back since #ICAC? #auspol #qanda
#qanda Tanya Plibersek will hopefully be our next PM.. We can only hope for a miracle next year!
@qanda hypocrisy by Indonesia, means expel their staff...if??
Have you repented, Arthur? #ICAC #QandA
#qanda oz gvt more barbaric than indo .. refugees are being killed
Can't we just bomb Jakarta #qanda
Who will stand up on @QandA  and speak on behalf of the farmers who shoot themselves in Australia?#qanda
We have to be so strong and clear on this as a nation. We expect our leaders to fight for those boys! #qanda
Amazing to see audience reaction to that news #QandA
Why "murder" these people, when they have been rehabilitated. Shame on Indonesia! #qanda
@QandA save the death penalty for real criminals e.g pedophiles, rapists and murderers
#QandA Wododo can be seen as a powerfully respected leader by cancelling the executions.
#qanda Good news, but only for a time.
#QandA Wow, something happened on QandA
How many episodes are going to go by without the panel acknowledging climate change.. #ujcomm2657 #qanda
@QandA the death penalty is wrong no matter what the crime or country. Come on, Abbott stand up for once.
Rare that such big news breaks during #QandA
#qanda They agree to hear the case but that does not mean a stay of execution on Wednesday!
Are the executions halted ffs? No one knows #qanda
If we shoot reformed prisoners, how will we ever reform another prisoner? -- Governor of Kerobokan prison. #qanda #mercy
Is Sinodinos a sub human or a droid. What a wierdo. #qanda
Sinodinos laying down his knowledge of corruption. Extensive knowledge #qanda
@theredandblue I don't want anything other than #Bali9 discussed. As a nation we need to talk about it, the impending horror #Qanda
Corruption amongst the Indonesian judiciary.  Who would have thought #qanda
No point in Chan and Sukumaran having their rights vindicated if they have already been executed. #qanda
Capital punishment isn't an answer. #qanda
Wow, 60 seconds and #qanda has a result!
#qanda I want all children out of detention.
#qanda http://t.co/tChnqqZXdz
Again, talking about this on #QandA solves nothing.
Did I just hear a c**t in the audience ask if Tony Abbott has done enough for Bali 2? Ffs! #qanda #SellTheTreasonousAbc
It is not for humans to decide who lives and who dies, no matter what the crime @QandA #QandA
Hooray! Hooray for the drug dealers! #qanda
whoa ok #qanda
I respect everyone who is rallying behind the two men facing the death penalty in Indonesia #QandA #ujcomm2657
Indonesia commuted the death sentence of two Iranian drug smugglers to life. Not Christians, just for Muslims? #qanda
Westerners trying to impose their colonial values on another eastern country....AGAIN #qanda
Wow that was quite a moment #QandA
The amount of money asked sounds more criminal than the original act of crime.  #qanda
It's cruel and inhumane, death does not advocate a stance on drugs #QandA
We've been presumptuous about what impact we think we can have on this process. And Indonesia no doubt wants us to know that. #qanda
Even if they hadn't 'repented' we shouldn't be killing people, that's murder not justice. #qanda
We kill hundreds of innocents every day. No reason for the outcry over these two drug traffickers #qanda
#QandA What Sinodonos is saying explains why government does want asylum seekers' stories told - don't be reminded that they're human beings
Don't applaud yet - we need to have that appeal confirmed by the Indonesian Govt and the stay of execution. #QandA
Sure ask Arthur - he will know #qanda
Must be bed time. Inundated with #qanda tweets lol
If Indonesia change their minds now, they will lose all moral authority #QandA
We should as a nation call to stop all executions occurring in our on own backyard @QandA
Really #QandA leading with Bali @QandA lets get serious, why should the execution not happen is the question, we want our laws respected
#qanda so the life of two drug dealers is worth risking the relationship between two counties????
How can human life be worth less than one person's political career?? #QandA
Blade is on Go #qanda
that's great sizzle, #qanda
Breaking news on #qanda
You heard it here first #QandA
This is as cool as it gets ... my wife on #QandA ... @SigmundMarx http://t.co/LVcQ8P7ZyD
@qanda at the beginning Sinodinis underestimated community sentiment? that means he didnt care till there were votes in it? #qanda
Wow, game changer in Indonesia ! #qanda
Terrible that Indo state sanctions "legal" murder of Chan &amp; Sukumaran. Indo also committing genocide in West Papua w/ AU complicity #qanda
How can you keep someone in prison for that long only to "murder" them everyone human deserves life. #QandA
Breaking here first #QandA #ujcomm2657
#qanda exclusive is the most legitimate use of #qanda applause ever
Indonesians watching QandA? #qanda
LIVE TV has never had such meaning #qanda
#qanda wonderful braking news on Qanda!
Wow! Talk about making news on #qanda
President Widodo needs the death penalty, he was elected on his tough stance on drugs! #qanda
#qanda then what?
@QandA #qanda Sinodinus failed the corporations act as a director of AWH. No credibility.
#qanda  Indonesian court agrees to hear further appeal for Andrew Chan and Myan Sukamaran. New court date 12 May.
Stopped being about justice long ago. These guys are just pawns in Indo's attempts to flex their muscle against Aus. #Bali9 #auspol #qanda
Any appeal is good news. #qanda
@QandA #QandA https://t.co/dNCsBsEaUM
Full on :( qanda
#QandA  Hurry up and shoot the bastards. They're always reformed after they're caught, aren't they? @QandA
The death penalty is sanctioned murder. #qanda
Appearing on #QandA must mean that Arthur Sinodinos now has his memory back.
good luck mum - you look great!! love your stylist! xx cat, sez and buddy. @sigmundmarx #qanda
Don't fool yourselves, Indonesia does not have the rule of law that so many Australians complain about. @QandA
RT- #qanda Indonesia will NOT halt executions. @QandA  https://t.co/IzwzQJBV7q
#qanda hopefully checked veracity of that news
@JaneCaro compared to other countries we go all out to save our own #qanda #bali9
@thebeckett44 @QandA always
If only the thousands who drowned at sea under Rudd/Gillard faced a firing squad then the left might actually have cared about them. #qanda
Does seem a bribe was offered to the judge and accepted, why was this OK by the defence. #qanda
@estherlf above the slime that Sinidinos trailed in. #qanda
Does this mean there will be a stay of execution? #qanda
God I feel like a monster for disagreeing with the general consensus on this #qanda
Withdrawing an ambassador, big fucking deal.  #QandA
Arthur can remember lots of things tonight just nothing in front of ICAC #QandA
@Brocklesnitch intense #qanda
#Bali9 appeal. RT @janetbackstage: Breaking news #qanda Indonesia have slated hearing for May 12
#qanda Everyone's always miraculously  "rehabilitated" when they're facing the death penalty
Quite strange if Indonesia presses this far to change their minds last minute #QandA
#QandA. What game is Indonesia playing?
Live breaking news discussion #qanda #Bali9
why aren't we talking about the 3000+ dead in Nepal, instead of two drug smugglers #qanda @qanda
#qanda how is our boat policy looking to the Indonesians?
#qanda And here comes the broken record
Not a democracy if there are executions #qanda @qanda
So are we sure that Australian citizen executed by a US drone in Yemen didn't have any artistic talent? #qanda
I hope this doesn't just draw out the pain those two men are in. #qanda
And the children being sexually assuaged on Nauru? Who cares, right? #qanda Let's talk about drug smugglers.
#qanda wish australia would look at refugees
The death penalty is not the answer @QandA #QandA
Surely these constant delays and incessant last minute changes are akin to torture #qanda
#qanda thank god we live in a society where the max penalty is life in prison!
I really hope that report is true... No one should die #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Obviously, not going ahead with the execution plans tomorrow. But it's still a political charade. #QandA
#QandA panellists may mean well, but VIGILS for DRUG TRAFFICKERS are an obscenity: whether or not you support capital penalties. #auspol
Great news to hear.  #qanda
Never assume any Arthur. #QandA
Indonesia agrees to a last ditch legal challenge. @QandA #Bali9 #deathpenalty
Our job is to maintain the rage between now and May 12. #qanda
It would be particularly frustrating if the appeal was heard AFTER the execution #qanda
#qanda AFP has much to answer for
Wow that's a big bit of breaking news to join the live stream on #qanda #UJCOMM2657
#qanda  Please, Dutton, Abbott, LNP in general, please show mercy. Don't imprison ppl who ask for asylum
What does the death penalty achieve except an unfortunately quite common and baseline desire for revenge? #qanda
#QandA Murder has no place in the judicial system of any civilised country.
Good news if it is true. I hope it is. #IStandForMercy #QandA
#qanda time lets do it
#qanda Sinodinos making his pitch to be Minister for Corruption?
Every life is important. If we were to cut aid for killing two Australians. Would others cut it from us for the hundreds of refugees? #qanda
@urallagirl they tolerate loss of life in other policy areas. #qanda
Australian media humanised and made these drug smugglers our friends. Don't forget their crimes and country's laws #qanda
It's about saving face #qanda
@QandA I don't agree with the death penalty but I also don't agree we should tell others how to apply their laws #qanda
This is good news indeed #qanda
#qanda Not a good person to ask if he thinks the Indo Govt could show Bali condemned compassion. They've never shown Balibo 5 families any!
The torture of being given extra time on death row. What strength of character these two men have #qanda
Tell me it's true, please #qanda #chansukumaran
We need to start saving all these lives at risk... @QandA
#qanda Will history judge Tony Abbott harshly for not taking a stronger stand?
When will anyone in the #AFP be held accountable for #Bali9?  #qanda
#qanda The constant stalling is just plain torture to the pair. Just give a reprieve already!
#BREAKING on #qanda. Bali pair to be given last-minute trial on May 12. Extraordinary.
The response to these two on death row has been so violent by so many Australians comes from a very racist place. #qanda
None of this changes the simple fact that capital punishment is fundamentally wrong. Always. #QandA
Clear that Indonesia wants to send us a message #QandA
@QandA @GuardianAus 99% of OZ public support execution OZ Ice epidemic how ironic
#QandA Nova 100 sent people to Bali for a holiday recently, does the community really care? @QandA
Hearing on May 12 won't necessarily affect the executions #qanda
#qanda move on
#qanda we cannot condone the deliberate taking of a life under any circumstances by state if we expect to see peace on our planet
Bit more than a 'penalty' ?  .... #qanda @qanda
The world will never forget if Widodo does not show mercy. His presidency will forever be tarnished  #qanda
It should not matter if you are rehabilitated, or have a loving family, or are an Australian citizen: no state should execute people. #QandA
Wow. Big news breaking on #qanda
when you go into a foreign country and break a law with obvious penalties and get caught it must face it #QandA
@kerrynannemoore I think you should get out more. #qanda
RT: The state should always represent the best within us not the worst. Be above death penalty. Rehabilitation &amp; mercy are strength #qanda
Publicity of executions exactly what Indon wants as a symbol of hopelessness for drug traffickers? #qanda
#QandA sure do the crime pay the time, I get it but really is death worthy of the length of time? Death is forever.
How to ruin two countries agreement..#UJComm2657 #qanda
Question for Mr Sinodinos: Where will Australia place in Eurovision? #qanda
But what about #MaryJane? Any reprieve for her? #Bali9 #qanda
@qanda. Revenue source?  Taxation inequality - why not tax churches?  Super inequality - 15.4% for public servants?!!!!!
omg omg omg omg omg I'm so happy about this #qanda
@QandA Sick of vigils for these dheads. These 2 clowns dying is better than parents having vigils for the kids their drugs may have killed
@QandA move over Tony - new host! #qanda
Be great if we could extend the same human rights to kids in detention that we do for convicted drug traffickers. #qanda
expecting answers on #qanda, seeeshhh
I feel like Australia is being taunted. Like clemency is being dangled in front of our noses and yanked back when we get too close. #qanda
Money talks justice walks #qanda
This whole situation is sickening. The crime was terrible but the punishment has been inhuman #qanda
Do the crime, go the time. How much have these drug dealers cost Australian taxpayers and distracted government from real issues. #qanda
@QandA #qanda How would Australia respond if Indonesia asked our govt to overturn a judicial sentence?
welcome news; more time bought for the Myuran and Chan #UJCOMM2657 #QandA
Julia Bishop's efforts with the #Bali9 getting justice is underrated. #qanda
Rehabilitated? #QandA
The Australian Federal Police have a LOT to answer for. #qanda
News flash - #QandA reporting that Indonesian court has agreed to hear appeal. #bali9 #KeepHopeAlive
Great news and an indeed very welcomed development #bali9 #qanda #ujcomm2657
#qanda Is it the ABC's job to rehabilitate Sinodinus? Is ICAC in recess?
Just confirmed on @QandA. A small sigh of relief for another a couple of weeks of life. #IStandForMercy #KeepHopeAlive
Assumptions make a something out of Sinodinos #QandA
Let's not forget the kgs of heroin they smuggled into a country that is widely known has the death penalty for drug trafficking #qanda
This woman can't stop talking #qanda
Let's hope that the situation in Indonesia is starting to turn around #qanda
#qanda audience reaction to that information update was great to see.
@qanda what about all other countries with death penalty and 32 states in USA where is the outcry over them executing people
Cannot imagine the pain and confusion the families the #Bali9 pair are experiencing right now #qanda
Watching a family member process the information live is heartbreaking @QandA
And the children being sexually assaulted on Nauru? Who cares, right? #qanda Let's talk about drug smugglers.
We cannot enforce our law or values on Indonesia #QandA
This process is systematic barbarism..state torture. #qanda
great to keep on fighting in the courts for andrew chan and myuran sukumaran #IStandForMercy #qanda
A human as the right to live there first and last life #qanda
Myuran &amp; Andrew will be shot &amp; in 6 months time it will be forgotten &amp; we'll still send aid &amp; buy Indonesia's goods #qanda
@SarahJMTaylor @QandA I would. If I could.
Tonight on #qanda, the panel asks questions of the audience it would seem.
This is the first time in months I've watched #qanda and it was worth it just to hear that news #Bali9
#QandA I'm certainly not convinced that the Australian government has done all they csn
When you ASSUME, you make an ASS out of U and ME... #qanda
I sympathise with these ladies, but not sure what else the Government can do? #qanda
#qanda There's hope yet!
Kudos, Indonesia. Let justice be served. Murder is no fitting penalty for any crime. #QandA @QandA #MyuranSukumaran #AndrewChan
#qanda I am sorry to see two people executed but I wonder if they had not been caught would they still be peddling drugs
They're not licked yet! Mercy please. #QandA
They are men not boys!!!! #qanda
Bali 9: Twitter 1 @qanda 0
Why don't we get this girl on the panel? #qanda
Get on a plane. Fly to the other side of the world. Still can't escape #qanda #priceless
#qanda May 12? Sounds like reprieve. It must be torture to keep going so close.
Rehabilitation becomes a tad harder when your prison cell is a wooden box in the ground #qanda
#qanda if the death penalty actually worked no on in the USA would shoot anybody else
#qanda take it as a comment tony she's rambling
Yes but I'm not sure the #qanda panel is empowered to act on that information
And then what? It's all breathtakingly painful to watch #qanda
Clearly both have received a reprieve for the next fortnight. #qanda
#qanda what about all the others that were to be killed with them, are their cases on hold until 12th as well?
Wouldn't be ironic if corruption saves the skins of convicted drug smugglers. #QandA
Will this decision be the death knell for president Joko Widodo in Australia's eyes? #qanda @QandA
Plibz and Fischer #QandA two of my fave Aus politicians.
If you devalue one person's life, you devalue every person's life. #Bali9 #QandA
Please don't say generalised comments please people... @QandA
They knew what they were in for when they committed the crime @QandA #qanda
Rare we get great news broken right in the middle of #qanda
Thanks Indonesia. Mercy please. @QandA #QandA
#BREAKING: Indonesia court agrees to consider appeal on May 12 - "This is a very welcome development" - Sinodinos #QandA @QandA
Murder is murder whether done by a man or a nation. #qanda
Perhaps Sinodinos is not the best person to ask about corruption. #QandA
Breaking news on #qanda, Myuran Sukumaran &amp; Andrew Chan have been granted another chance at an appeal to be heard on the 12th of May
corruption might save them #qanda
No surprise that a nation born from rehabilitated criminals fights for the lives of two others #qanda
#qanda zinadinas talking on judicial corruption....priceless
And justice for all... #qanda
#qanda Sinodinas is a proponent of the harsh laws and approaches to drugs that have led to the potential trajedy of the boys' execution
#qanda How much money have their families squirreled away from their heinous drug crimes? @QandA
@qanda Sinodinis wears a cloak of virtue, hiding his complicity in the pending executions. Corrupt, lying dog.
Breaking: Indonesian judicial system is corrupt. #qanda
The death penalty is cruel, inhumane and degrading, regardless of who is accused, the crime and the method of execution #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Honestly am truly over hearing about the 2 executions pending. Heroin kills people and these 2 supplied death #qanda
#QandA spontaneous applause for breaking news re Indonesia @Q&amp;A
Nice to see the judicial review process does exist in Indonesia #QandA
People are dying in the streets as a result of drugs in Australia - why should we mourn two people who are the cause of it #qanda
Report on @QandA that the Bali duo have been granted a court date on May 12. Appeal seems to have been heard - they live another day!
Indonesian justices seems to be the money or the gun. #qanda
Incredible news breaking on #QandA that #BaliNine duo have one more chance to fight for their life on May 12.
How cruel to keep them dangling. Commute and let them breathe. #QandA
Wow, #qanda just beat #ABCNews24 in breaking news.
Perhaps we should #boycottbali #qanda
Indonesia, it's not justice your justice system we question, it's your humanity #qanda
@QandA The govt had a chance to intervene when they first tried to board a plane by dealing with it here rather than politicize it #quanda
#qanda not breaking news first. @marcfennell tweeted this at least 2min ago
Corruption and executions - not a democracy #qanda @qanda
Corruption is accepted and embedded in most judicial and business processes throughout Asia, sad but true #qanda
#qanda last ditch effort!!! Please fully investigate legal arguments and alleged corruption..
#qanda Death to those who can make change!! Political point scoring no wonder Indonesia has a drug problem
@qanda Is Australian government doing enough to support Nepal for immediate relief after a devastating earthequake #qanda #NepalEarthquake
#qanda Great breaking news for Andrew Chan and Myan Sukamaran!
20 years ago it only cost Rp1,000,000 to buy a judge #qanda
Where is the AFP representative on tonight's #qanda Panel?
@TurnbullMalcolm @mcintinhos Yes mostly. However most young Australians chose NOT to fight in WWI. #qanda
Extremely important issue on discussion tonight regarding the #bali9 #ujcomm2657 #qanda
and Australia's "war on drugs" is working #qanda @qanda
Thanks for not forgetting the other 7 #qanda
#qanda told me so - I know everything I need to know.  It wasn't Brian.
Indonesians playing a strange mental torture on #Bali9 #qanda
@QandA 3200 dead in Nepal and  2 convicted drug smugglers are somehow more important.
#qanda has anybody seen Arthur Sinodinos and George Brandis at the same place and time?
If this pair weren't Australian, we wouldn't be hearing about this. We only care about human rights when our citizens are affected. #qanda
We get it. We don't agree with Indonesia's justice system #qanda
sinodinos has a tow ball head #qanda
Indonesia is not Australia's best friend #qanda
The auto-cue is always right Tanya! #qanda
@tanya_plibersek will be the next female PM #qanda @JB_AU @QandA
Holy shit #qanda
No celebrations until Andrew and Myuran have clemency. #IStandForMercy. #qanda
#IStandForMercy #qanda
Always great to see reactions and not pre-prepared answers on #QandA #ujcomm2657
#qanda If only Sinodinos had advocated that asylum seekers could also be known and tell their stories as with #Bali9 @qanda @14luxor
Do we care only about Australian drug smugglers or does this apply to all nations? #qanda
Come begging to #QandA for a democratic solution. #BaliNine
#qanda #ujcomm2657 Yes they have been rehabilitated, but the issue is beyond them. One must think of all the lives they would have destroyed
Hold on: when did Sen. Sinodinos become the panel's expert on Indonesian law? What would the questioner have him say? #QandA
Australia's relationship with Indonesia will be forever tarnished #qanda
Jokowi will never lose face, the executions will proceed for that resson and domestic political considerations #qanda @qanda
And meanwhile in Australia,  people are arguing to " euthanase" the elderly, who are starving and neglected.  #qanda
#qanda no one is offering refugees a second chance like the bali 9 #refugees
@QandA Do you really believe that the executions will be delayed?
Great news from Bali-9. Stay order. #qanda
#QandA I am watching Q and A with my computer. TP is all class.
#qanda and here now comes the washing of hands of the powerful
Tim Fischer when will we get great rail infrastructure in Aus, high speed passenger and inland freight? #qanda
Where there is life there is hope #QandA
Death penalty, aside from all other arguments against it, risks making martyrs out of criminals who shud be quietly rotting in jail #QandA
@qanda #qanda  Sounds hopeful and good, but seriously do we trust the Indons? They might go to court, but a posthumous  hearing?
#qanda Withdraw our heroin dealers now.
Nothing but neanderthal willy waving by Joko/ Indonesia #QandA
#qanda @tanya_plibersek we need to exercise caution on how information is being delivered
Oh great. Another "fair hearing" in an Indonesian court. #qanda
It's not that Australia's not doing enough. Indonesia is flexing it's muscles. We've underestimated them and we're paying the price. #qanda
#QandA where would the bleeding hearts be if the drugs got into the country
#qanda Clearly the Indonesian lawmakers take no notice of the rehabilitation clause in their Act.
How horribly cruel to first be faced with death, then be given potentially false hope while trying to find your peace. #qanda
Discussing breaking news on #QandA is a really bad idea.
@QandA The Bali pair were 2 of nine. I wonder how the other 7 are #qanda
Do the crime,do the time. Law says death penalty applies. I disagree with it but that's the law their democratic parliament chose #qanda
#QandA Anzac Day has become a cult that promotes and glorifies war - any contrary opinion is punished.
Remember if Abbott didn't treat #Indonesia with such contempt &amp; use it as dumping ground for refugees maybe things would be different #qanda
Apparently executions being delayed till at least 12th of May. Glad to hear it. Now we need to stop the murder from ever going ahead #qanda
Very welcome news  #QandA
While there is life there is hope but this adhoc Indonesian process is torture for them both. #qanda
High drama on #qanda
What about #MaryJane? Any reprieve for her? #Bali9 #qanda
#qanda @QandA A little tear in my eyes, with hope for the boys in Indonesia!
Breaking news: Indonesian government agrees to hear appeal. But will this stop the execution? #qanda
The guard of auswitz has repented. He could be spared any capital punishment #QandA
and we have no corruption in our judicial system #qanda @qanda #thereisnojustice
If we can spend $700,000 dropping the 'Co' from 'NBN Co' we can spend $130,000 to bribe a court to save Australian lives. #qanda
The death penalty affects nobody except for friends and family. #qanda
Breaking: Executions of Bali pair delayed. Appeal to be heard on May 12 according to #qanda
Australia has no legal right to infringe another country's sovereignty - no matter how repugnant we find those laws #qanda
#qanda Is there actually going to be an appeal? What's the point if they would have already been executed on the 29th Apr?
#qanda stop telling a sovereign country what they can and can't do in their country. Imagine if Indonesia did that to us!
It must be devastating to have the lives of your loved ones in such a volatile state #QandA
This process is beyond cruel. #qanda
Really loving these two questioners, thank you very much #qanda
@matt_levinson @AuskarSurbakti does appeal on May 12 mean they wont shoot them tomorrow? #qanda #bali9 #mercycampaign #KeepHopeAlive
If the executions go ahead Australia should stop turning a blind eye to West Papua. #QandA
2 drug smugglers get the death penalty &amp; Aus freaks out, 400,000 West Papuans killed by the Indo Military &amp; we say nothing #qanda
The showmanship of Indonesia over the last few months, especially the past 24 hours is disgusting! #BaliNine #Bali9 #qanda @qanda
Celebratory response to Bali bomber executions did not help the cause of the Bali 9. Need a consistent anti death penalty stance. #qanda
@QandA off with their heads!
Pliberstick doing top notch gravitas #qanda
#qanda @QandA they were well aware what they were doing was illegal and aware of indo laws
@AnthonyForsyt10 @SigmundMarx that tops a tweet on #qanda
#QandA Sick of vigils for these dheads. These 2 clowns dying is better than parents having vigils for the kids their drugs may have killed
@QandA #QandA God will save our lads cos tony wont
#qanda @qanda Sinidonis Bali9 we know them as people. But we are banned from knowing refugees to feel compassion for them.
Liberal party zero tolerance approach to drugs is the very source of the problems associated with drugs in Aus &amp; elsewhere #qanda
@QandA  If execution goes ahead. Indonesia will NEVER see one tourist dollar from me. Small fry, but I don't care.
Star of #icac Sinodinos talks "repentance" on #QandA but irony lost due to news of Indonesia hearing appeal that delays executions.
How can we respect a legal process which is potentially corrupt #qanda
Is #QandA on my Apple Watch?
From the bribery claim it looks like Indonesia has a wonky rule of law at the moment. #qanda
@QandA #qanda Tanya Plibersek is our next PM.
Has Sinodinos got any comments about corruption? #qanda
@QandA #QandA The caveat is, Aust is against capital punishment, for Australians.
Very interesting and relevant point of discussion tonight #bali9 #qanda #ujcomm2657
#mercymrwidodo #qanda
@QandA #qanda BREAKING NEWS we just heard is fantastic. The old saying ' no news is good news' isn't necessarily true!
#qanda Maybe diplomacy really can work, after all.
#QandA Well done Tanya take that piece of info with a big pile of Salt until verified.
Tanya is  always a voice of reason on #QandA
Now get rid of those fucking 29-4-2015 tombstone crosses ... #qanda
@tanya_plibersek sounds note of caution on speculation #qanda
#qanda Drug dealers kill others indirectly by bringing drugs in Australia. This is their time now.
@QandA #QandA Australia should be consistent about death penalty around the world including USA. #auspoI
Every time I think I'm done with #QandA, you demons pull me back in.
everyone take a hit and relax #QandA
They don't deserve death, but they committed the crime knowing the consequences #qanda
#qanda I had high hopes that Widodo would be the strong leader Indonesia needs, but he is showing nothing but weakness.
They like to see us beg #qanda
@newscomauHQ @AdamHillmedia @QandA FUCKING KILL THEM OR LET THEM GO. THIS SHIT'S BEEN DRAGGING ON FOR 10 FUCKING YEARS. HOLY FUCK.
Jokowi talked about reform but is yet to make good on commitments. Talk is so cheap in politics all over #qanda @QandA
#qanda Poor souls http://t.co/WX1Hf1UPs2
@QandA If Labor makes marriage equality a whipped vote, should the Liberal Party make it a conscience vote? #QandA #MarriageEquality
This level headed approach is why Tanya should be PM. #qanda
These lives are at big risk... #qanda
Tony Abbott is not giving this the attention it deserves. I'm sure if it was his daughter /daughters, it would be a different story. #qanda
You'd want to be right with that #BREAKING news, Tony #qanda #bali9
@tanya_plibersek 's classic pre-answer inhalation kills me every time #QandA @QandA
the whole process is just so heartbreaking and nihilistic #qanda
Tanya Plibersek would make a woeful foreign minister if Labor were to win the next election. She is HOPELESS! #qanda
Killing a human being is murder, no matter who you are #qanda
I think we should all tell the Indonesians what they should and shouldn't do a bit more #qanda
#QandA All discussion about this case on QandA should stop now so we don't give them any excuse to falter the legal process
Just waiting for the ghastly, shameless Plibersek to turn #BaliNine issue into kick against LNP Govt... #QandA
The point of prison and the judicial system is to allow rehabilitation of individuals #qanda
Breaking news and the politicians, as ever, go through their talking points #qanda
Understand it's a prominent issue but how many times do these women get to ask the same question? Same women as prior?  #qanda
Bali9 pair spared until May 12th when the Indonesian High Court will hear an appeal according to #QandA
I have much respect for @tanya_plibersek a measured and sensible politician #qanda
Due process has been tampered with by corruption. #qanda
Human rights begins at home @QandA we have no right to criticise any other country
Talk about news breaking! How's that #qanda
@liamdolbey on the other hand, #theplib! #QandA
Hard to see that any pressure by Oz would do much but stiffen Indonesia's resolve.  Though hope should not be lost #QandA
@QandA #QandA Meanwhile genocide is occurring in West Papua and no one notices
Delayed execution? #qanda
I'm sick of being told that they are boys, rather than grown men who committed a terrible crime. #qanda
these bali 9 people every week are even more annoying than protesters #qanda
Everything about the way @tanya_plibersek conducts herself is pure class #qanda
No one knows if the appeal will delay the execution though do they? #qanda
Save the lives of all 7, this horror must stop #QandA
From #QandA @JewelTopsfield #balinine https://t.co/dR496XEzhF
Has  Joko returned the PM's call yet? #QandA
Looks like another postponement of #chansukumaran execution.You wouldn't wish this sort of roller coaster on your worst enemy. #qanda @QandA
@QandA #qanda I doubt the indos will honour their end of the deal for the may 12 appeal for the #Bali9 duo
That newsflash on Live TV makes up for the usual dead air on #qanda
#qanda the fact, is no-one in Australia knows what the outcome will be.
Dodgy Arthur to repeat his #ICAC triumph on #QandA
The rest of the people are going to be shot tomorrow night though, they get no reprieve. #QandA
Do we oppose the death penalty, or just for Australians? #qanda
Does the ABC have jurisdiction over Indonesia? @QandA
Keep fighting for human rights! #qanda @qanda
What about the other death row inmates? Why are we only outraged about the death of Australians? #qanda
Never assume anything Arthur. #QandA
#keepthehope #qanda
What about Mary Jane Veloso, Filipino migrant worker who has just been denied her appeal?Please let us not just focus on Australians #qanda
I believe that if the bali 9 leaders are rehabilitating other inmates why shouldn't they be allowed to live #qanda
Ok everyone, you don't have to thank someone for their question! #QandA
@QandA #QandA let's not forget these fellas committed a crime!
In reality, Australia can really only do so much. Indonesia has the right to implement law, no matter the outcry in Australia #QandA
Keep the people talking #qanda
#qanda   Vote with your feet- do not visit Indonesia.
#qanda Lest we forgot http://t.co/dtCKEKmR3U
#QandA @QandA I oppose the death penalty, but I also oppose children in detention, a pox on both Australia's &amp; Indonesia's houses!
Two people on death row in Indo, and thousands of people dead in Nepal and no comment on how pitiful Australia's response there is. #qanda
That news has been known for weeks. President and A/G say executions will go ahead #qanda
@QandA thank you Tony and Tanya for speaking about not jumping the gun on the breaking news
@QandA #QandA If the legal processes find corruption, bring them home. They wont want back into Indonesia again
@jokowi_do2 Please spare the lives of all on death row #qanda http://t.co/WfqQPecQOD
Time for Australia to fight death penalty across the world, not just when it's our citizens affected  #qanda
#QandA wha are they playing at! It is just so cruel
@qanda #qanda any chance of reprieve for refugees being tortured by #auspol?
Will be interesting to see the panel respond to a live break in this case without any preparation #qanda
A corrupt judge gives Joko an out-clause to simultaneously show mercy without losing face #qanda
#qanda drug smuggles kill as does the death penalty. Both are barbaric.
Capital punishment is prolonged torture. #qanda
@QandA THEY ARE CRIMINALS!! They have committed a crime and they should be punished.
Why focus on Indons killing 2 Australians when they have also killed over 400,000 West Papuans #qanda @QandA @tanya_plibersek
I wonder if #qanda will feature tweets calling for their execution like they did tweets advocating race riots.
President Widodo needs to realise mass murder is a worse crime than drug dealing. He will be condemned for this gutless act #qanda #Bali9
Its a media report please lets not inflame the situation If the Indonesians lose face it could be disastrous @QandA #qanda
#BREAKING: "We need to be careful on this latest media report" @tanya_plibersek #QandA @QandA http://t.co/Nf7hYJZa6C http://t.co/lncDBfxrp9
All justice systems require a provision for mercy. #qanda
Unfortunately #auspol has acted very entitled towards Indonesia re #Bali9. But still state sanctioned murder is evil #QandA
Always the voice of reason and balance @tanya_plibersek #QandA
How can any country be considered civilised and still justify state sanctioned murder? Including all our "mates". #qanda
"...much worse drug crimes got lighter sentences" omg this is disgusting! #qanda
Tanya for PM. #qanda
Tony Abbott's threats have not helped, President Widodo wouldn't even answer his phone calls! #qanda
Why wasn't there THIS level of outrage for the other 7 of 9 bali smugglers? #QandA #AusPol
Yea they are great guys #qanda
@Jacksimpson32 @QandA I think sleep is a better option!
Anyone else tune out when @tanya_plibersek drones on and on....? #qanda
Don't forget the other 7 on death row. And if Chan &amp; Sukamaran are executed don't forget them @qanda #qanda
I wonder how a possible execution of Chan &amp; Sukumaran will affect the future of Australia's relationship with Indonesia? #QandA
Where's the humanity in society? Death penalty is NOT the answer. #QandA
#qanda  Legal processes in Oz are skewed and deliberately eschew natural justice. How come Oz criticises Indonesia?
@newscomauHQ @RachelLegzxx @QandA Miracles could happen#pray
Thinking about getting a lift sized tattoo of @tanya_plibersek on my face. #qanda
@QandA Changed my mind from them paying for the crime to letting the Bali guys doing time aiding other prisoners. Such a waste if they die.
Mercy is strength.  Everyone has got the message about drug smuggling from this. You don't have to kill them #qanda
#qanda more stalling by the Indonesian government waiting for a bribe
Maybe if Australia didn't tell Indonesia what to do, they wouldn't be being so stubborn in standing their ground! #qanda
Both Myuran and Andrew have proven that they have rehabilitated themselves while inside Kubohknan Prison. #qanda
If Indonesia fail to act on corruption allegations it will simply confirm that they are corrupt @QandA #qanda
Indonesia is corrupt as all get out. Rip the aid off them at tell them to POQ #qanda
Very hopeful news regarding the #Bali9 pair on #qanda new appeal court date set May 12th #hope
Death penalty for non-violent crime is abhorrent #QandA
We cannot influence the processes of the Indonesian judicial system, we can only watch them unfold. We do not have the right to. #qanda
#qanda they did the crime and knew the risks, the death penalty isnt right but its the risk they took.
Asylum seeker kids have committed no crime, yet we lock them up. Where is the consensus concern for their human rights? Hypocrisy. #qanda
Did Sinodinas really just imply the #Bali9 appeal was the result of LNP involvement? #qanda
Amazing and surprising news from Indonesia (if confirmed) #QandA
It may the 11th hour decision for the Bail drug mules  #qanda
Arthur Sinodonis underestimated our capacity for compassion re executions of #Bali9 ...there lies the dark heart of the right #qanda @QandA
#qanda wont somebody think of the children
@qanda just apply Indonesian law to their nationals in our jails. Show how much we respect their laws.
Looks like the Bali 9 have won another reprieve #QandA
It's a bittersweet conversation to have #qanda
Cutting aid or attempting to punish Indonesia will make the situation worse. We cannot afford to lose that relationship. #qanda
I feel so terrible for those men, mixed messages much? #qanda
I agree with you @FearBlandness #qanda
If true, what does the 12 May date for Constitutional Court appeal mean for #chansukumaran? Will it halt the execution? #qanda
It's funny how you repent when you're on death row. What life will they have if its revoked?  #QandA @qanda
Jesus @tanya_plibersek you're talking without saying anything #qanda
No matter what happens on May 12 this drawn out process is basically cruel and unusual punishment #qanda
Be careful? Someone's about to be shot because of drug trafficking, pretty sure their death won't stop drug trafficking  #QandA
Interesting that we Aussies are prepared to believe Indonesian system is corrupt on the report of the man defending #bali9 #qanda
#QandA does anyone feel sorry for the kids who have died taking the drugs
It's very cruel to impose this sentence after 10 years of rehabilitation! #qanda
#qanda media reports that Bali 9 get last minute reprieve. New appeal will be heard in May. I hope this is the case  #keephopealive
#qanda Indonesia's mistake was not executing them ten years ago they are now reformed too late to do it now - save them from the bullet
Remember, they're drug smugglers who threw seven others to the wolves, not heroes. #qanda
The good news is no one in Indonesia is doing drugs now. #qanda
#qanda  by not exercising clemancy and then in the face of corruption to still kill is prima faci a crime against humanity
#qanda Fight for the victims http://t.co/LD5pE7AV4T
#QandA It must be torture for their families
Laws can be changed @QandA #QandA
Australian policing agencies must also be held accountable for their roles in enabling the upcoming executions of Chan and Sukumaran. #QandA
If the executions go ahead Australia should at least stop turning a blind eye to West Papua. #QandA
#qanda any questions allowed on TPP tonight?
Believe it when it happens. #qanda
#QandA disgusted that abbot has not rescued these lads
#qanda Sinodinos doesn't have any moral compass except " community attitudes have shifted "
Maintaining the rage didn't work too well for Whitlam #qanda
Contrast with @JulieBishopMP's attitude toward GreenPeace protestors jailed by Russia. Have to traffick heroin to get her sympathy? #qanda
You're only one tweet away from ruining your life #QandA ... To quote the last program.
#Qanda would they be rehabilitated if they were caught. Anyone with half a brain would rehabilitate if they had a death sentence on them.
I'm not convinced by the telepromoter on #QandA. I want confirmation they are alive at the end of two days from now.
#QandA the death sentence of the Bali 9 being compounded by further delays.  Is this cruel and inhuman treatment ...torture? 20 yrs
This on again-off again execution is in itself cruel and unusual punishment.  #QandA
Abbotts attitude towards Indonesia could be adversely affecting the Bali 9 #qanda
@DobZombie because they did not get death sentences. #qanda
Omg people need to learn that  we are very lucky to live in this world  and they shouldn't  stuff it up... #qanda
@FearBlandness, you're not a monster. They committed the crime in full knowledge of the consequences. #qanda
@PalmeroAshley @QandA killing these two won't make any other criminal respect the law. The evidence proves that already.
@QandA does anybody remember that these people are guilty? #qanda
@QandA 100 years since Gallipoli &amp; since the women's peace movement @WILPF began - what have we learned about foreign relations &amp; peace?
Death penalty is not OK, we need to be putting far more pressure on Bali @QandA #qanda
The death penalty doesn't stop people committing crimes... end of story #QandA
Argh! #qanda showed my tweet about how I feel like a monster. Of all the tweets!
OMG. It's been 10 years!  #qanda
zzzzzzzzzzzz Tanya #QandA
The last thing the Bali prisoners would want is for Toxic Tony to go &amp; visit the Indonesian PM &amp; use his 'people skills' #QandA  #Auspol
This must be torture for the families of the two men #QandA
Does the ABC have jurisdiction over indonesia? #qanda
Are these 2 just pawns in a massive.political game both internally and externally #qanda
Dear Tanya: will you be our PM? #qanda
Tanya Plibersek choosing her words carefully #qanda
Rare that it's on #Qanda we hear breaking news.
@QandA  Plibersek thinks debt can be repaid to society? How so? #qanda
Everyone knows the Indonesian judicial system is corrupt! The truth needs to come out now #qanda @QandA
People power might actually save these boys lives #QandA #quanda
Arfur, the best friend the Environment has ever had  He uses Paper Bags for everything #qanda #QandA @qanda #auspol  #FederalICAC

Most boring #QandA ever! http://t.co/YvoyBZEBgK
$125k bribe to the judge. Can we have more information on this #QandA
Rehabilitation or not, murdering people is modern barbarianism #qanda
Good point. It's a sentence on all who know Chan &amp; Sukamaran. Not just the 2 men themselves #qanda
BREAKING #qanda, Myuran Sukumaran &amp; Andrew Chan have been granted another chance at an appeal to be heard on the 12th of May
Indonesian government should be arrested for murder #qanda
@mythicagothiga @SarahJMTaylor @QandA So would I.
#QandA we can't even protect our own inmates like Carl Williams from being murdered, forget Indonesia @QandA
So many Australians saying "they knew the risks" etc. To them I say: you are the problem #qanda @QandA
Bali executions has be delayed #QandA  Urgent Update!
Malaysia executed Aussies years ago &amp; we still trade with them. It'll be forgotten &amp; be business as usual #qanda
A corrupt judge? OMG. #qanda
Death penalty is really only a punishment for the surviving family members #qanda
Chan &amp; Sukumaran are not victims,let's stop feeling sorry for them.Be sorry for their families.Say no to drugs and drug smugglers!!  #qanda
#qanda Tanya Plibersek seems very moved by Indonesian news, but advises caution @QandA
Indonesia determined to carry out the executions but wanting to protect its reputation on legal process #qanda
Sultan of Brunei, care to weigh in? #qanda
Indonesia has nothing to lose but much to gain by being compassionate in this matter #qanda
#qanda @tanya_plibersek  speaks so well.. She is like the voice of reason. Always! #teamtanya
hearing @QandA reporting the #Bali9 pair will have a hearing before Indonesian Constitutional Court. Does this mean death penalty delayed
Let's not forget the 8 others facing execution. #qanda
Why are we wasting our time protecting drug dealers. People that can harm our children. #QandA
@QandA Our system of justice is not global.
@tanya_plibersek gives a calm and compassionate measured response to death row news. Careful not to insult indonesia #QandA
The Quality of the Tweets being displayed makes this seem little more than the Truman Show... #qanda
Criminals having all rights once again. They wanted to deal 9.8kg of misery here is Aus #qanda #nojustice
#qanda Indo govt tough talk on drugs, is the same as #auspol tough talk #refugees
A lot can change in 10 years... Indonesia should focus on rehabilitation not murder #ujcomm2657 #qanda
My god she is such a bore #qanda
Plibersek waffling on about crap can we move onto someone else #qanda
Plibersek for PM. The lady knows how to talk to people, a great communicator #qanda
TB measured sensible and diplomatic as always. #QandA
AFP should have just arrested them here. We could have avoided all of this. #qanda
Tanya a voice of reason as usual. #QandA
#qanda it's this kind of debate that can change people's lives.
Why are we not concerned about all global citizens on State sanctioned death rows? #QandA
If desperate people are willing to commit these crimes even with the death penalty as a potential punishment, how is it a deterrent? #qanda
Shooting somebody no matter what the circumstances is murder #qanda
Leading by example provides for a better outcome and influence - we  failed them on many levels #qanda
#qanda How would Australia react to someone being given the death penalty in a country like the United States?
Imagine a world in which foreign "criminals" are treated worse than local criminals. Not on Australia's watch!   #qanda
Will we have Chan day? #qanda
@qanda #qanda while we are discussing australian's unfairly persecuted by foreign countries, can we briefly mention julian assange?
@AuskarSurbakti @MercyCampaign News just broke on @QandA
We're objectively better than Indonesia. It should listen to our ideas and advice. #QandA
#qanda I think May 12 will just delay the inevitable
"The judges are corrupt! I tried to bribe them as it didn't work!" is all I'm hearing #QandA
The laws relating to drugs need major rethinking #qanda killing people for smuggling drugs is like killing someone for breaching duty free
I can't even imagine how Andrew and Myuran would be feeling right now given this report #qanda
"while they are alive they can repay the community" yeah and consume good people's money. #qanda
@QandA Had they not been caught, would still be dealing! Die Scum
Seems Indonesia is getting sick pleasure from emotionally torturing these poor men #qanda
@QandA @GuardianAus Plibersek married to trafficer poor judge of charachter
#qanda Plibersek always giving calm advice
Arthur Sinodinous head so shiny I had to adjust the tv contrast #qanda
#QandA when will we start tackling Indonesia on human rights atrocities in west Papua? We hear nothing from politicians.
#qanda how often do we reflect on the use of capital punishment in the USA?
Sad that young men are to be killed thanks to laws inspired and imposed by the U.S Christian movement #QandA
Is it really up to us to instruct Indonesia on how to handle these matters? @QandA #qanda
Goodness, imagine if all people who owed a debt to society were in jail.  Some high places would be much quieter  #qanda
Tim Fisher; you're alright. Senator; not so much. #QandA
Exchange #Bali9 for AFP chiefs who tipped off Indonesian police, with knowledge they'd face the death penalty. #qanda @QandA #auspol
Are Australian going to say the same about American states executing their own, or just the Indonesian government. #qanda
#qanda @JewelTopsfield tweets that appeal won't affect executions
NOT CONFIRMED Breaking news  #qanda, Myuran Sukumaran &amp; Andrew Chan have possible chance at an appeal to be heard 12th May
The utter torture of this limbo state the Chan and Sukumaran families must be feeling. #QandA
Is it best to discuss this case considering latest developments? Especially as #qanda has done before?
Sad to say I can't see them listening now if they haven't yet #qanda
@MarianRakosi @tanya_plibersek @JB_AU @QandA Oh God please let this happen
Tomorrow is the anniversary of Port Arthur. This black day hopefully won't be made blacker. #qanda
The problem is with the Indonesian courts @tanya_plibersek it's clearly corrupt. #QandA
The stress all endure re Bali9 should be a sobering reminder to anyone contemplating drug running #QandA
The waiting must be mental torture. #qanda
Word clouds are the 2015 equivalent of infographics #qanda
The help they offer others will ultimately save Indonesia money, and help Indonesians! #qanda
@QandA Indonesia can be proud that its jails can rehabilitate young drug offenders so perfectly. Sad &amp; a dreadful waste for executions.
#QandA I don't see the problem, we ask people to respect out laws when they come here, why can't we do the same?
#qanda  @qanda why can't they be returned to Australia to serve a life sentence?
Plibersek the perfect person to witness and promote the rehabilitation that can occur from convicted drug dealers #qanda
@qanda @tanya_plibersek keeping a level head!
I don't understand why people think a death sentence reprieve means the #Bali9 guys come home. It's life in jail. They broke the law. #QandA
Great news. If there is a stay of execution. The evidence of corruption needs to be examined if Indonesian justice is to be credible. #qanda
Just because there is a hearing doesn't mean there is a delay to the executions - which is ridiculous, but the truth. #qanda #ujcomm2657
#QandA so does this mean we should all go silent on Social Media
Ten years of court processes is surely enough #qanda
A meth factory mogul with massive cash reserves managed to 'persuade' Indonesian "judges" to forgive a death sentence. Corruption? #qanda
#RT #BREAKING : Chan &amp; Sukumaran's lawyer says Indonesia's Constitutional Court 2 hear appeal May 12 #Bali9 #QandA
O'Shit Mike, talk about the empty vassal  http://t.co/QMSEmtNMXH #auspol #qanda #abc730 https://t.co/4MUL3nAa8P
The $ 130,000 bribe is an allegation it is not yet a proven fact. #qanda
The Indonesian court is corrupt! Why do we need to tippy toe around this?!  #qanda
Yes, Indonesia should be proud of rehabilitation. @QandA
#qanda The AFP should answer to why they didn't stop the Bali 9 leaving the country in the first place.
@QandA .12 may. what does this to-ing and fro-ing do to the mind? th a torture continues.
Cannot correct a wrong by committing a wrong. Wrong to kill another human being. #qanda
Plenty of controversial topics up for discussion tonight #QandA
Tony is the king of ruining a moment.. #Plibersek had everyone engaged and jumps in now cuts her off.. now moves on.. #qanda
@DarrylSmith42 hope Australia does not win Eurovision because I hold hate for us t host it. #QandA
Maybe those idiots shouldn't have broken the law. Hurry up and shoot them #QandA
#qanda if you want to go to someone else's country you have to follow their rules! Plain and simple!
Apparently more important to look hard on drugs than hard on corruption #qanda
#qanda reporting that #Bali9 to have a stay of execution due to an appeal heard 12th May. Great news.
@QandA #fearless you are not alone. The default sentence was death. That's what will happen!
How bout we immolate them instead of shoot them. On live TV ? #qanda
@SteveStricklan6 just talked about on qanda ..SBS article
@MattSainsb we gave them $5million in aid #qanda
AFPs role in Bali9 still to be investigated #qanda #auspol
#qanda https://t.co/TusNEs6KUO
@QandA @toogoolawah Don't think he'll ask this question lol
#QandA It's a pity the Australian Federal Police are not being fully held to account for dobbing Chan and Sukumaran in to Indonesian police
Get this shit off the air #qanda @qanda
From the off Sinodinus surprised at how sentiment has shifted ... says more about own moral malleability #qanda #auspol
Is it not less about Chan &amp; Sukumaran and more about justice and mercy? #qanda #questionsforjokowi #mercy
Advice if you get caught by Indonesian cops - pay big and pay quick. #QandA
@QandA Why doesn't anyone mention or question the police that let them leave Australia in the first place? #qanda
AFP should have thought a few chess moves ahead and caught the #bali9 in Australia.  #qanda
@QandA the death penalty has no place in 2015, surely as humans we have evolved beyond this form of punishment #qanda
Ummmm... Apartheid was the law once in South Africa. Just because laws exist doesn't mean they're just #qanda
Be nice if the government put as much effort into asylum seekers as they have to these two. #qanda
Myuran will be more famous than Van Gough alive or dead. Preferably alive. #QandA
#qanda Tanya for PM http://t.co/E7qGfcAvHU
@qanda How much blame 4 the state murder of these 2 men should AFP take? #qanda
@QandA this is about humanitarian opposition to State killing. It's not political. It's bipartisan and merciful.
The savage Indonesians have probably realised they can make a quick dollar by taking the bribes. #CoinForIndo #auspol #qanda
#qanda wonder why we aren't pushing USA to stop capital punishment? Let's just pick on Indonesia
We must respect Indonesias state sovereignty #qanda @qanda
Looking forward to hearing @tomporteous speak at UNSW this Thurs on #refugees @KaldorCentre and @UNSWLaw #qanda http://t.co/0uFfTucSSu
Indonesia gains nothing but loses a lot if the death penalty is imposed #QandA @qanda
#QandA politicians as always too little too late. Political arse covering.
People sound surprised to hear Indonesia might have corrupt justice system #qanda
We need to remember $honkodino$ was The Rodent's CoS when Keelty served the Bali 9 up on a platter to the Indos.  #QandA
the death penalty punishes families and loved ones more than perpetrators especially in this case    #QandA #UJCOMM2657
Let's recognize the limitations of our government in influencing another country #qanda
Great news. If you support state executions you are filth. #qanda
You don't go taking drugs into a country that has zero tolerance on drugs. Smugglers know that, it's the risk they take. #qanda
Yes drugs can ruin lives, but ruining the lives of their families and taking A's + M's lives is not the solution #QandA @QandA #ujcomm2657
This is why you shouldn't invite nationals anywhere #qanda
#qanda Ask the question to families battling with drugs right now in Australia feel !!
The fact that the Bali 9 were arrested in Indonesia and not here is a massive failure of the AFP. they were knowingly given up to die #qanda
So 2 lives will be lost for a failed drug smuggling atrempt. How many would have been lost if they were successful? #qanda
If Tony and Julie get them clemency, I guarantee the left will find something to whine and hate about   #qanda
Well said Tim Fisher #qanda
Mmm remorseful and rehabilitated so name the ring leaders if the government are so supportive they will protect you #qanda
To be anti-murder is to be a bleeding heart, apparently. #qanda
#qanda our country rocks
Yes Tanya is fight. Step carefully with this latest news. Spruiking corruption will not help. #qanda
#qanda Indonesian politics is overriding human life.
the media love this. it is over the top. get over it. #qanda @qanda
Why is the Australian Government not sending the best legal defence possible  team to defend Chan and Sukumaran? #qanda #May12
#qanda  Australia does not help rehabilitate its prisoners. Too many young people locked up not able to give back to our society.
#QandA it would be good if we could get a stay of execution on the thousands of people who die daily from drugs.
#qanda  https://t.co/0x3jFz4c47
We should be fighting to protect all the lives threatened by the death penalty, not just those of Australians #qanda
#qanda http://t.co/Bo3zp0B6tA
Too late in terms of media saturation on this issue I think #qanda
We must stop one execution to stop others.  #qanda
The death penalty diminishes us all, no matter what culture, race, religion @qanda #qanda
I wish that would be so RT @KieraGorden: Tanya Plibersek for PM. #QandA
@QandA Such a wise woman be very careful what we say#qanda
But they broke a law. If you have an issue with the law then don't smuggle drugs. It's not hard. #qanda
Will Widodo really change his mind? I #qanda
Some tweeting advice: Tweet often. Be on topic. Keep it short. Keep it clean. Always use the hashtag #QandA Don't reply or start w/ @QandA
Tanya admitted to the crime, hey Tim. #qanda
If Indonesia truly wanted to get a message across to Australia not to bring drugs to their country, they've made it now. #qanda
@QandA never give up hope
Chan and Sukumaran are not even asking for freedom. They are asking to be incarcerated until the days of their natural deaths. #qanda
#QandA lots of observations no action
At the end of the day, it's an issue of whether people deserve to die and whether capital punishment actually works. #qanda
#qanda were the Bali 9 repentant prior to getting caught @QandA
@JoeyWarriner Yes, exactly like the Gallipoli landing @ScottMcIntyre #qanda
Cultural sensitivity is important, but nobody should be killed by any government. #QandA
Such great news if correct re Indo constitutional court to hear appeal re Aussies on death row #QandA
We should not just respect a country's 'sovereign law' if that law breeches international laws and goes against humanity #qanda
Agreed no more media circus on two criminals please!! Lets go and focus on something way more important...the situation in Nepal!!! #QandA

Immediacy of news cycle can be devastating. #qanda audience applaud what they believe is news of delay in Bali executions. 1/2
#qanda Good news! @QandA  https://t.co/0dYvCW67eP
My God. What a rollercoaster. If the news is right that the Supreme Court is hearing an appeal, that's great. #qanda
Tanya being extremely careful as she should be but it's hard to watch  #qanda
Why are we waisting our attention on these drug dealers when their are MILLIONS of starving men, women and children in Turkey. #qanda
If you do drugs you must expect to die at some point #qanda
innocent trefugees are tortured by #auspol.. but we only care about drug crims #qanda
Seems @tanya_plibersek has upped her Xanax. Thankfully, hasn't interfered with her capacity for hyperbole #qanda
Breaking: Myuran Sukumaran &amp; Andrew Chan have been granted another last-ditch appeal to be heard on May 12th #qanda #Bali9 #chansukumaran
Australia would be in a better position to claim mercy if it were not returning refugees to persecution or caging them indefinitely. #QandA
@tanya_plibersek obviously rattled by latest news of #Bali9 #Sukumaran &amp; #Chan on #QandA
Drugs are no where near as bad as our governments and media try to cnvince us they are #qanda Time to stop swallowing the lies
Punishing the taking of lives with the taking of lives is nonsensical #QandA #ujcomm2657
#qanda as long as every possible avenue is being investigated, Chan and Sukumaran are given hope.
@QandA #qanda we just heard positive news from Indonesia - let's not go on about corruption etc, let's be positive!
Football drug scandals never see any further charges than maybe a suspension... This is just inhumane #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Can't wait to hear from Carolyn Holbrook @SigmundMarx , a strong new history voice for #AnzacDay #QandA
#QandA best cup of tea ever!!! And best start to #QandA ever....
Tim Fischer advocates for life sentences for drug peddlers #QandA
Tanya is violently opposed to the death penalty - unless its for Bill Shorten #Qanda
Can we move on from this topic? There is an ice epidemic and we are trying to save lives of drug dealers. A bit ironic? @QandA
#qanda wow, they publish some stupid tweets, but I guess it's democratic. Death penalty is pure savagery.
#QandA The Age Facebook page just reported that the Bali 9 ringleaders will be forced to say their final goodbyes on Tuesday. Which is it???
I wonder how remorseful they would be if their heroin had killed an Australian #QandA
Yes, the law is stupid. But it still exists. #qanda
#qanda Just because a country has sovereign law doesn't make that law right.
Arthur Sinodinos &amp; @tanya_plibersek discuss the stay of execution for #Bali9 pair &amp; claims of corruption #QandA http://t.co/vvt8mWqrqF
#QandA so true Tom
You can't wait ten years then not re-evaluate changes. What Indonesia is doing is torture #qanda
The Indonesian system corrupt? What do you think? #qanda
What about the AFPs role in this? #qanda
Careful, Tom. We don't like all this "human rights" talk here (not if the government is listening). #qanda
#QandA Famiies who have lost children to drugs might not be so sympathetic. It is a death penalty not a criminal penalty, not saying I agree
#qanda The death penalty punishes the family more than it does the perpetrator.
People need to realise that we can't interfere with the judicial processes in another country. Simple don't do the wrong thing @QandA
There doesn't seem to be any room to disagree with the general consensus in #Australia #qanda
Over the top media in Australia? No never lol #QandA
I'm sorry, but rules are rules. #QandA
@newscomauHQ @tanya_plibersek @QandA A good police making sense.

It's fantastic to see bipartisan support against the death penalty #qanda
These sorts of issues are what Team Australia is really all about #QandA #quanda
What really is the purpose of a death penalty? It has been proven to be ineffective #QandA
The death penalty is barbaric in any one's language #qanda
@qanda In today's Morgan poll, Tanya is preferred Labor leader. Will she challenge?
The so-called boycott by Australians travelling to Bali hasn't eventuated. Numbers are up year on year for March! #qanda @QandA
@tanya_plibersek for PM #QandA
And that's exactly what the media has become when it comes to Bali 9 - a circus #qanda
Capital punishment and genocide- Indonesia guilty, AU govt complicit.  #freeWestPapua #qanda
The death penalty is a pathetic, primitive reaction. #qanda
Arfur Sinodinos doesn't see a problem with public officials taking conflicted payments from the private sector #qanda
#qanda don't care about the two drug pushes tbut if want to hurt stop going to Bali
@JadenHarris95: When one persons human rights are infringed upon, it's an attack on everybody's rights #QandA #auspol
#QandA At last a glimmer of hope?
#QandA @QandA #Jokowi's justice is as big an oxymoron as the 2013 Budget Emergency
#QandA  This program demonstrates what it means to live in a free country.
A media circus is exactly what the #BaliNine pair need #QandA @QandA
Seems cruel to be playing games and giving false hope. #QandA
Without a central global government we will never get global agreement on allowing the death penalty #qanda
@JayLFRodger @QandA seriously as soon as this happens it becomes real, it will make others think,
The death penalty is about ruling by fear, but it doesn't even deter #QandA
So if Chan and Sukumaran get off, what does it mean for everyone else who is convicted of the death penalty for drugs in Indonesia #QandA
#IStandForMercy #KeepHopeAlive  praying this means a stay of execution @QandA #qanda
If I kill someone, it's wrong. If a nation does, it's wrong. #qanda
@QandA #qanda Lets talk about genocide in West Indonesia

Breaking news on #qanda #Bali9 prisoners #AndrewChan and #MyuranSukumaran to receive a fresh appeal
Money will buy freedom and lesser sentences in the Indonesian legal system, fact. #qanda
Research has proven the death penalty isnt a deterrent  #qanda
The death penalty is ineffective, yes! Someone said it! #QandA
The death penalty is pointless. It doesn't serve true justice. #qanda
12 May court date was announced yesterday! Photos of crosses showed date of death 29 April. #chansukumaran #IStandForMercy @QandA
whether rehabilitated or not or an Australian citizen or not - no state should have the death penalty #qanda #ujcomm2657

This is difficult enough for us watching on this side, I can't imagine how hard it must be for their families. #qanda #mercycampaign
@QandA we can't control corruption in other countries especially when we can't control it in our own
Death penalty is an act of savagery Well said #qanda
#QandA it is amazing how sorry people are for their actions when and only when they get caught
#qanda .. How many people would've died had the heroin made it to Australia?

Has anyone got a sympathetic word for the misery of an addict  @QandA
So rarely has there been such an illustrative example of incarcerated people exemplifying the principle of rehabilitation #qanda
#qanda when do we see the Indonesian corrupt judicial system go on trial?
the death penalty should never be part of a civil society #Bali9 #qanda
#qanda The death penalty is a deterrent. I've never seen dead criminals reoffend.
#qanda @ quando How awful for these families to live with and fight this sentence in the courts.
I know #qanda will probably not put this on TV but it's easy to seem "rehabilitated and "repentant" when you are placed behind bars for life
No one likes the death penalty but it exists in Indonesia we have to deal with it @QandA #qanda
#qanda I'll call it now given news heard earlier today re 130K. Retrial?
Please keep making noise for Myu and Andrew. Murder is never the answer #qanda #keephopealive #istandformercy
We know the death penalty is an "act of savagery" which is why we don't have it in Australia #qanda
Is there a Kenny Rogers Roasters next door to the #QandA set? Don't think the audience will be getting any sleep tonight.
Porteus is right- any death penalty is uncalled for. Even Bali Bombers. #qanda
"The death penalty is a total act of savagery" - well said Tom Porteous #qanda
People should be this up in arms about the death penalty all around the world #qanda #auspol #deathpenalty
@QandA Indonesia holds no moral ground on corruption, history shows that there is a clear morality vacuum in that country, sad but true!
Andrew and Myuran should have their death sentences commuted and repatriated to Australia for eventual release. #QandA
#QandA would they have reformed if an imminent death sentence wasn't on the cards?
Tanya Pliberserk , labour's voice of reason @QandA
@JewelTopsfield @QandA on ABC right now saying that another appeal will be heard for Chan &amp; Sukumaran on May 12. Can you confirm?
It is state-sanctioned murder. It is wrong; ineffective and wrong, under any circumstance. #qanda
The death penalty is ultimately for the politician who was elected on his/her allowing it, not society! #qanda
#qanda Where would those clamouring for the death penalty be if it were their loved ones about to be executed?!
The death penalty is "an act of total savagery"- @tomporteous #QandA #ujcomm2657
ScottMcIntyre is fully rehabilitated now .. #qanda
#qanda USA has death penalty for black people via some Police
We are such constant hypocrites. #qanda
#qanda @tomporteous your voice is incredibly soothing. Keep talking.

#qanda Animals kill each other not people.
So important to note: death penalty is not effective at deterring crime #ujcomm2657 @QandA #QandA
Everyone deserves a second chance for redemption. We have all made mistakes.  #qanda
Wrong. The death penalty is the mature approach to the most serious crimes #QandA
Murder is worse than drug smuggling #qanda
Let's face facts. Indonesians want to kill some Australians to prove a point. #qanda
@QandA  Don't smuggle DRUGS
Tim Fisher blithley declares the two Bali guys should have a term 'for their natural life' ..fuck off Tim Fisher #qanda #auspol
Death penalty's savage - and it's ineffective - why do it? #qanda
Surely they must realise this makes us terrified of travelling to Bali? It's not good publicity #qanda
If Prison Break taught me anything, this delay will now allow them to escape #qanda
You don't have to have convince us that the death penalty is bad. We know! That's why we don't have it #qanda
Our system is still largely based on punishment over rehabilitation #QandA
#qanda Well I'm sure the idea of death penalty would minimize it !!
The Indonesian government is dangling a toy in front of a kitten... They're now just playing with the Australian government #QandA
We are we so happy to look away when our 'great friends' in the U.S. are killing people every year #qanda
If corruption can be proved then death penalty should be abandoned but if no corruption is found then they broke indo law #qanda
The death penalty ensures that criminals do not re-offend #qanda
The really nonsensical thing is that executing drug smugglers does not deter dealers nor users. #qanda
Heroin killed 135 Australians in 2005. Where's the outrage for these deaths? #qanda
@qanda they have already served 10 years-that's a long time even for a crime of this nature!
As an American I think these guys deserve a fair trial before anyone is punished #QandA
How cruel has this whole saga have been! Does not bode well for Indonesia's image.  #Bali9 #qanda
Can't get your question read out on #qanda ? - send it in to #askgazey and let the nations flagbearer answer it for you.
#Qanda I can't see Indo officials delaying their moment of global Sovreign glory for a mere Appeal. That might mean losing face.
#qanda Such a disgrace the Indonesian legal system is, saying legal challenges should be allowed to run their course is a joke.
Have to feel for the families of Chan &amp; Sukumaran whose own lives have now become an emotional yo yo of grief and hope. #qanda

#UJCOMM2657 #QandA No one has asked that they not be punished. Punishment and death are two very different things.
#QandA the time of stupid westerners not knowing the penalty for drugs was over 20 years ago. Stop the whining over unworthy idiots
Australia needs to work on helping every human, not just those that are considered "Australian" #QandA #ujcomm2657
@tanya_plibersek is a voice of reason and commonsense - #primeminister material methinks @QandA #qanda
Tired of the "if the drugs got here' red herring. We have no death penalty anyway. #qanda
Is it ok to mention the complicity of the AFP in all this today? I don't want to stray from the narrative.... #qanda
The irreversibility of the death sentence is the only logic required to eradicate it. #QandA
When one persons human rights are infringed upon, it's an attack on everybody's rights #QandA #Auspol
@QandA They got caught, but did prior drug runs and got through.Got caught and now pay the price. #QandA

Wododo sullied ANZAC Day. Puppet circus appalling, immaturity on show. Not opposed to death penalty but Wododo has crossed line. #qanda
#qanda @QandA  will Au govt now cease all sharing of information with Indonesian authorities which may result in a death penalty?
The death penalty - premeditated murder carried out by the State #QandA #ujcomm2657
The death penalty is a feral excuse of an punishment #QandA @QandA
I don't believe capital punishment is the right answer. #qanda
There is no grace in any form of execution. It is simply barbaric #QandA
Indonesia executes as a punishment not as a deterant. We don't seem to understand that. #qanda
And yet it's amazing how many Australians would like to see capital punishment reintroduced #qanda
#Bali9 duo should not be executed, but Australia shouldn't put asylum seekers in jail either. Our outrage is selective. #qanda
The Indonesians are hypocrites- ask for clemency for their own but give none to others #QandA
@SparkCycles Don't worry, we're there too! Plenty of bleeding hearts for all human rights abuses #qanda :)
@tomporteous is so well spoken. Thank you for mentioning that the USA has the death penalty. It's barbaric no matter how it's done. #qanda
#qanda This Tom Porteous makes a lot of sense.
#qanda Do the two boys #Bali9 know that the Indonesian court has agreed to an appeal?
never been a more ineffectual phrase than "we should not have a media circus about this" #qanda
Not all states in USA have death penalty. In some death penalty abolished before Australia. #qanda
When will Sinodinos call this human rights bloke out for being blatantly partisan? #qanda
#qanda UN should have power to stop barbaric act such as this
Why is no one asking the AFP why they didn't arrest the Bali 9 in Australia instead of tipping off Indonesian authorities #qanda
Let's take a moment and think of their families. What an awful predicament #qanda
#qanda capital punishment for those in huts or those with big building. Civilisation has not evolved no matter the amount of street lights
The decision is terrible but it doesn't mean you need to generalise all Indonesians #QandA
Death penalty is an act of total savagery: Tom Porteous, HRW @qanda
@qanda #qanda justice system flaws aside, it is difficult to see much difference between killing someone and locking them in a box forever
#qanda could you stop normalising heroin trafficking...its not like jay walking.
Listen to @tanya_plibersek #QandA Best for everyone if we just back away from this topic right now. Let this new dust settle.
When innocent people are put to death their is no come back from the death penalty #QandA
Many innocent people are executed, the error rate is far too high! #qanda
How did 'they like to see us vet's get through? Racist much? #QandA
To take a life as punishment devalues all life #qanda
The best argument is to give Indonesia a better model against drugs  to replace the death penalty #qanda
This gives the families new hope, but it is just prolonging the inevitable pain for the families? #QandA #ujcomm2657
Without the"media circus" the death penalty would have been carried out long ago #qanda
Indonesia must preserve its sovereignty. The executions need to go ahead #QandA
There is always time for mercy #qanda
#qanda @qanda  I have heard of other cases regarding the bribery for other cases such as Spain. Money talks just get the proof.
#qanda we as Australians are conscientious objectors to the death policy so our foreign policy should reflect that
@QandA Indonesia can be proud its jails can rehabilitate young drug offenders so perfectly. Sad &amp; a dreadful waste for executions.#qanda
Glad someone mentioned the #US tonight, they seem to fly under the radar a bit in the death penalty debates @QandA #QandA
#BREAKING Indonesian court agrees to consider appeal on May 12. @tanya_plibersek: "we need to be careful on [this] report" #auspol #qanda

Australian Ambassador is now confirming the May 12 appeal. #qanda
@qanda Why didn't the Australian Govt put in the same effort to release David Hicks as has been made to save the Bali Nine?
@qanda no thinking person suggest these two should not suffer long prison terms but many fundamentally disagree with state sanctioned murder
Execution of Australians overseas is not ok, but abuse of asylum seekers in Australia is ok? #QandA
Awareness of crime doesn't impinge on moral arguments relating to the death penalty #QandA
I don't understand the support for Indonesia's death penalty. If we are against it here, we should be against it everywhere #qanda
Does Indonesia want to be seen as a modern country or a country of barbarians? #qanda
it's not savage if the death penalty removes pedophiles,   murderers and rapists.  #qanda @qanda
Chan and Sukumaran are NOT innocent, that's the point. They are not only confessed, but MAJOR int'l drugg traffickers. #qanda #auspol
YES, pointless savagery achieves nothing and solves nothing #qanda
@QandA what's the AFP think about turning them in???
#qanda why do the panel members preface answers by re-stating the entire issue? It's painful, get on with it!
So he's an English American Sam Neill ... thx for that dude. #qanda  please
Drug trafficking is a disgusting offence, 8.3 kilograms of family and community destroying filth deserves what is coming to them. #QandA
#Qanda Let's remember Nazi Germany &amp; many repressive regimes have been 'sovereign nations'. Not a reason to be silent.
Death penalty is barbaric and inhumane. It is murder authorised by the state. Not a deterrent to serious crimes #auspol #qanda
In 2014, at least 22 countries around the world carried out executions. #DeathPenalty #QandA
"Savage" the perfect way to describe capital punishment #qanda #ujcomm2567

#qanda Whether for the deathpenalty and whether they should lawfullybe subject to the death penalty are two completely different arguments.
This is torture of these men. Their lives hanging in limbo, unsure if they will be given a last minute reprieve. Incredibly cruel. #qanda
Killing drug mules does nothing to deter the people who employ them, and who are never caught.  Death penalties are barbaric. @qanda
The decision to actually implement a death penalty imposed by a court seems to rest largely on political considerations. #qanda
#qanda seems some Aussies we're excited about an execution.

Far too many people still bay for death penalty in Australia when crimes are reported in the news- so many without compassion. #QandA
@QandA If we are talking death penalty lets discuss china or is that of limits
Judges in Australia take bribes just as much as they do in Indonesia @QandA #qanda #auspol @NSWSupCt

#qanda @QandA They deserve punishment but they DO NOT deserve to die

Has anyone thought of the kids that might have died from these drugs that don't get a second chance #qanda
Can we swap Tim Wilson for Tom Porteous?  #QandA
#QandA The indonesian govt like to make Aust dance to their tune. We need to boycott
Tony Abbott is not an asset in this case at all #qanda
#Qanda The quicker these drug smugglers are executed, the better for all. Think of all the damage drugs have caused to Aussie families
@SteveStricklan6 you're right link not there despite those headlines by SBS but qanda seems to back up that news
Wonderful breaking news. Where there is life there is hope #qanda
#QANDA  POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO,,,,
the judges in their case admitted they never wanted the death penalty for the boys @QandA
#Bali9 execution is the first topic of discussion on @QandA. http://t.co/21MJqmE2Cy #qanda http://t.co/gHqKZGAHfi
A brief sigh of relief for Myuran and Andrew with the announcement of another appeal. #qanda
#QandA Our system of justice is not global.
#qanda Good news for #Bali9 &amp; fellows but #judicialcorruption in #Australia remains taboo! So wrong!
Any judicial system is fallible, and an execution is irreversible. #qanda
@QandA #qanda The US thinks the death penalty is a crime deterrent. Wrong - get rid of guns!!
how do we campaign "more strongly" in a practical way against the death penalty? #qanda
@qanda If the death penalty worked as a deterrent, it wouldn't need to be carried out.
@QandA would Indonesia's president like to pull the trigger up close himself? I don't think so
#QANDA  POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO POTATO,,
Killing them brings no utility. All it does is create further pain and suffering for the families and those officials who procure it. #qanda
Australia needs to fix its own human rights, before it can say anything about another countries human rights!!! #qanda
#qanda Hopefully a legitimate legal process can go forward and proper justice see their lives spared
Many who once approved of or were neutral about the death penalty are now strongly opposed to it.  #qanda
Death penalties are futile as a deterrent and brutalise communities #IStandForMercy #qanda
This will still come down to good domestic politics from Widodo, but disastrous internationally #qanda
Good point. Let us remember that Indonesia are not the only country with the death penalty, and Australia does business anyway. #qanda
@GlenHunting @AndrewJaffrey Yep but watching QandA and Plibersek advises caution...
Regardless of the chan/sukumaran situation, it's time to draw a line in the sand #qanda
I feel so terrible for those men, mixed messages much? #qanda 3
Plibersek = Gillard MkII #qanda
Tom Porteous. Ok. #qanda
Enough FFS! Just shoot the fools so we can get back to sport being the headlines in Australia. #qanda #Bali9
You can see the pain in @tanya_plibersek's eyes #qanda
No one should have the decision on when somebady's life end #UJComm2657 #qanda
@QandA empathy for addicts, not the traffickers and dealers
Islam kills people for being gay...no protest there #qanda
@QandA PS: I'm against the Death Penalty AND these guys knew the risk and choose to pursue the rewards at the cost of other human deaths!
And whether or not the death penalty is right or not is not the issue here. That's the law there. What about refugees here ffs?! #QandA
Unbelievable the number of people who seem to have no sense of compassion in this #QandA
#qanda We need to create a new global communication platform about the inhumanity of the death penalty @qanda
The Indonesian argument for the death penalty is extremely weak.  #qanda
Does Human Rights Watch have a position on #WestPapua, #asylumseekers and the forced closure of #Aboriginal communities? #qanda
The death penalty does not deter serious crime. We must rethink the belief that spectacles of punishment will make communities safer. #QandA
I like this @tomporteous bloke. Can we keep him? I know someone involved in human rights we could trade for him.. #qanda
Prison sentence and rehabilitation is the only way forward... Not killing people #ujcomm2657 #qanda
#QandA Thank you @tomporteous pointing out this is not just abt a single event but Australia should campaign against death penalty anywhere.
#Qanda - you are not comparing apples with apples - Sharia Law v. the Westminster system.
Why did it take 10 years to have this discussion? #qanda
Bipartisan support but little action #qanda
Are we now saying all death penalties should go? What about mass murderers that don't deserve to live another day? #qanda #Indonesia
#qanda WE CAN'T DENY ANOTHER COUNTRIES LAWS BUT WHEN THEY DONT EVEN ANSWER PM CALLS IT'S AN INSULT TO AUSTRALIA NO MORE AID PAY THE PRICE
If you're pro-death penalty would you be prepared to hold the gun and shoot? #qanda
Two rehabilitated men that aren't a threat to anyone are going to be murdered. Are we still living in the dark ages? #qanda
#qanda https://t.co/OHOLb1woJb
Tanya Plibersek isn't a member of the government Tony #qanda
To support capital punishment is to believe in the fantasy of human perfection. #qanda
If Australians are genuinely against the death penalty they should have protested the executions of the Bali bombers as well #qanda
Media should stop asking politicians to make threats to Indonesia. It isn't helping. #qanda
Oh I wish @tanya_plibersek was leader of the ALP! She is humble, accessible, charismatic, realistic and socially aware - inspired #QandA
Don't forget, the Australian Federal Police aren't blameless in this matter. #qanda
I don't care if they knew the punishment. The Indonesian Govt bribes other nations with the penalty to get citizens off. #QandA
Stoning, shooting, beheading, injection - it's all inhumane. #qanda #istandformercy #KeepHopeAlive
Australia is not well placed to comment on human rights #qanda
It seems those saying "they knew the risks" have never been young, stupid, addicted, in debt or deserving of a second chance #qanda
Let's talk about the genocide in West Indonesia @QandA #qanda
@tanya_plibersek speaks wisely &amp; cautiously, again. Class act #qanda
31 women killed by partners in 15 wks in 2015. Consistent form. What's being done? Truly. At risk of being yet another squeaky wheel. @qanda
@QandA #QandA  what is this doing to the prisoners mental state?
I feel we should suspend judgement till we've heard from Bjorn, Tim Wilson &amp; Barnaby #Qanda
Joko may still want the sacrifice of drug offenders, but the symbolic value will be lost if process is found corrupt #qanda
So if they are successful and if they return to aus, will they be heralded as heros? #bali9 #qanda
#QandA smuggling drugs into Indonesia also implies the help of corrupt Indonesian police. No firing squad for them?
So who wins the votes if these blokes are spared? #QandA
If we sent the money that was spent on trying to save the Bali 2 to Africa we would have saved tens of thousands #qanda @qanda
Turning back boats? Do we have a humanitarian leg to stand on? #qanda
Threatening to take our people out of the embassy is weak, and will not help! #qanda
#qanda This is becoming farcical. Psychological torture for Andrew and Myuran
As a matter of general policy, we should no longer assist with intelligence that could lead to a capital charge for our citizens #qanda
If they'd committed these crimes in Australia, they'd probably be free men by now. #qanda
#qanda Sounds like a yes to me Tanya
We, like America, like to tell other countries how to run their country #qanda
The judge corruption allegation in Indon drug case has come out just before the execution of penalty. A timing - just a coincidence? #QandA
No one single act can be punished by the death sentence, whatsoever. No exceptions #qanda
We oppose the death penalty for Australians overseas yet send many to their death sentences with returning refugees &amp; "boat people". #qanda
Drug smuggling is a lifestyle choice @qanda
Why don't we help the million starving citizens of Turkey before we ponder about these drug dealers? #qanda
Yes Tanya. The answer is yes. #qanda
If we tweet things anti-Indonesian, will we be sacked from QandA? #qanda
and agree with #qanda https://t.co/ViFqXR3PgM
#qanda So much sympathy for the Australians smuggling drugs into a foreign country. If only there was as much sympathy for asylum seekers.
I feel like all of Australia is standing together relieved; that there still is hope. Until 9 May... #KeepHopeAlive #IStandForMercy #QandA
Tanya Plibersek doing a good job of not saying anything at all. #qanda
We criticise Indonesia but this is as much an indictment on the global war on drugs which we too are complicit in #QandA
One upside of this story is in focus Australians on why we should never have death penalty #qanda
The loss of respect for Joko Widodo has been profound over this #qanda
Indonesia can either go ahead with the atrocious act and embarrass itself. Or back out, and embarrass itself. #qanda @QandA
More restorative justice needed worldwide #qanda
Classy Tanya Plibersek, classy. #qanda
We must stop ALL state sanctioned murder everywhere, not just for Australians #deathpenalty is evil @QandA #qanda
Students and teachers from Castle Hill High School stand for mercy #qanda
Ahh fuck! I forgot #qanda was on tonight. Twitter is in its usual fucked up meltdown
I oppose the death penalty everywhere. @QandA #qanda
Cough cough ahem China cough cough #qanda
@QandA Is there anything 'official' from Indonesia about the 12 May legal challenge? #qanda
#qanda The hypocrisy of the Indonesian government is unbelievable!
#QandA Value Life not Death!
@evilsnoofy on screen! #QandA
#QandA why don't we just change Indonesia's legal system ,while were at it
How many of the people saying that these men should be put to death are also in support of Sharia law? #qanda
The AFP must be breathing a sigh of relief tonight  #QandA
Don't worry are hearts are bleeding for refugees too. #qanda
if i've learned anything about arguments it's that you can never weaken someone's ability to make one #qanda
#qanda makes me wonder why ppl take drugs
I feel so terrible for those men, mixed messages much? #qanda 4
#qanda Tony you crafty fellow
Detention and Death Penalty are 2 very different issues #qanda
Here's hoping the Indonesian Government sees reason, and that the unnecessary deaths of two reformed people are prevented. #qanda
#qanda Tom Porteous Human Rights Watch: countries opposed to the death penalty should pressure those nations with capital punishment to stop
I don't think this kind of open public/media discourse on this issue is beneficial - it might damage official diplomatic efforts #qanda
Stupid question Jones #qanda
I don't agree with the death penalty but how many people could have died from their heroin? #QandA
#qanda human rights - how is this applied to capital punishment?
@QandA Australia shouldn't be turning a blind eye to West Papua anyway!! Our Foreign Policy with Indonesia's been weak since 1975! #qanda
@QandA #QandA If these executions go ahead, Australia should have nothing to do with Indonesian corruption
#qanda What about the Australian Man sentenced to death in China for drug trafficking? Where are the approaches to the Chinese Govt for him?
It's 2015 and 36 countries still use capital punishment. This is a travesty #qanda
We can't kill someone who's become an artist for god's sake #qanda
#IStandForMercy   #QandA  #Bali9 http://t.co/MmvwKEesj3
Rather let 1000 criminals go than submit one innocent person to death. #qanda
I think we as Australians need to boycott visiting Indonesia and let their Government realise how much money we bring #qanda
#Qanda The paramount universal principal is "thou shalt not kill" and DRUGS kill. However, the Bali nine need to live so they can repent.
Hey here's an idea. Let's not kill people. #qanda
#qanda I highly doubt it...sure the relationship might change for a little while, but it'll go right back to where it was.
The "bleeding hearts" for refugees are here too! Don't worry. #qanda
#qanda  Indonesia must not break international law by continuing with executions #IStandForMercy
Rehabilitation doesn't earn you the right to avoid execution. Unrepentant criminals should not be murdered. #qanda @QandA
What sort of person actually carries out these state-sanctioned executions? #qanda
Far out, let someone else talk! #qanda
"Where there is life there is hope"- there's have been neither for the victims had the drugs gone through #qanda
Literally watching misinformation explode before my eyes on Twitter right now @QandA #qanda #Bali9
HAS Arfar got his memory back yet? @QandA  #auspol FED #ICAC now http://t.co/Wy3DMqWBTG
Death penalty is futile, better use of resources in dealing with cause of behaviour which is reflection on our society #qanda
Very diplomatic answer Tanya. Can't risk threatening Widodo like Abbott did.. #QandA
@QandA I live in Jakarta, and the president needs jailing for his corruption, I have paid him thousands in return for favours
Giving the family and loved ones hope for a few extra days is devastating if the Indonesian government go ahead with executions #qanda
I'd definitely call for our govt to reevaluate relationship with Indonesia if killings go ahead #qanda #bali9
Indonesia, it's not just your justice system we question, it's your humanity #qanda
#QandA it is after all pretty simple that if you cannot do the time then don't do the crime
Tim Fischer, the former Nats leader, who linked changing the flag to "yoof" and aged unemployment https://t.co/ZMSS46TQp4 #auspol #QandA
Bali 9 executions are more than #auspol debate. 58 nations still have the death penalty - including US. Its not just about Indonesia @QandA
7 ignorant mules led into life imprisonment by this pair. Constitutional challenge applies prospectively, might not affect pair. @qanda
@Deyterkmahjerb @QandA #ratbatcat
Does anyone understand *why* Indonesia imposes the death penalty for drug trafficking? Look at some stats #QandA
#QandA Death penalty is just for violent killers. But Not for drug couriers . Joko will look weak and loose face if reverses his hard line .
When people die unexpectantly that is hard! To know these 2 reformed Aust citizens are to face a firing squad is gut wrenching #qanda
#QandA would they have turned their lives around without the threat of death penalty or life in prison?
#qanda 1000s dead in Nepal, my own sister is stuck in the country - why isn't the government doing to help Australians!
QandA Oz in no moral place to talk about HR abuse. We may not kill by bullet but we are destroying thru insanity
Human rights - pifttt - minority rights rule Australia #QandA
State sanctioned killing is wrong. The level of our outrage should not be conditional on degree of rehabilitation #qanda
#qanda We should re-evaluate our relationship with Indonesia, as citizens of the world
I wonder if Australia would campaign so strongly for the #Bali9 release if they were facing the death penalty in Texas. #qanda
#QandA https://t.co/5YQ1dhLV5q
No government is perfect, free of corruption, free of unjust laws... #QandA
@QandA @Women4Abbott So fudge the numbers to at least appear like you give a crap about your charter?
The most haunting thing about the death penalty is it's irreversibility. #qanda
#qanda I wonder if there would be Australian society/government/etc would be more vocal if there were no Australians involved
Thank you for the two women who are asking such complex and important questions, thank you #qanda #bali9
@QandA they have been rehabilitated but they never disclosed who was there ring leader #ringleader #QandA #drugs #Indonesia
If only we extended this mercy to migrants and refugees that are escaping societies like this #qanda
@qanda how can govt and opposition kill #refugees and still take high ground on death penatly
@evilsnoofy, well said #qanda
Widodo is stuck with pleasing his ppl and ruining tourism and Australian relations #Bali9 #qanda wouldn't wanna be in his shoes
#qanda why shall people that have murder Hundreds of person's and get years yet these Australia men get death!
Next topic please... #QandA
#qanda @qanda Countries like Australia oppose death penalty on one hand, and then support it behind closed doors on the other. Tipoffs.
@Barbarella500 These two are Peddlers of death, let's not tip toe around that either #qanda
What the hell is Indonesia supposed to do - say yes go ahead kill our citizens @QandA #qanda
@qanda The Libs have sympathy for drug smugglers, yet lock up asylum seekers and turn boats back for people to face persecution. #qanda
Clouds of cotton at the mo Harvest on the Liverpool Plains  #qanda

Agreed! #qanda https://t.co/tiCeMGyf6X
@qanda bleeding hearts have room for all injustices
We'll fight tooth and nail for two drug criminals crying human rights but ignore our treatment of refugees #qanda
But MUUUUMMMM. He was my FRIEND. That means the rules don't apply to him. #qanda
Indonesia's justice system apparently good enough for those lifeboats full of vulnerable people we tow back there... #qanda
#QandA sick of these 2 nutbags getting oxygen from the media. Siick of hearing about them. Stop being apologists.
Plibersek showing steady &amp; considered leadership here. #qanda
Tom your in the wrong country "Human Rights" is a touchy subject @QandA #QandA
@QandA #QandA  Indonesia's extrajudicial killing policy possibly a bigger human rights issue than the judicial one
#qanda What Indonesia does to its death row inmates is just as bad as what we do to the refugees we imprison.
#QandA can we please move onto the next question already?
What about our treatment of aboriginals here?! And they're not running drugs in a foreign country. No bleeding hearts there #QandA
"Australia should be condemning the death penalty in any country, INCLUDING America" #qanda #bali9
And how many deaths would 8kg of heroin caused. What about addressing that issue #qanda

@QandA blimey ... her again? #qanda
@QandA bad timing by me but Tanya looking like PM material
Dealing with a very corrupt country. We should just stop sending the aid. #qanda
Remember what John Howard said.....just don't have anything to do with drugs.  #qanda
Legal processes are just postponing the inevitable and creating false hope #qanda
We might not have the death penalty, but our country denies justice to many by other means  #QandA
@QandA we need Tanya to be our opposition Leader. She explains and talks very wisely
@QandA #qanda U do it every week force me to watch live on line and the feed is so slow &amp; keeps refreshing its so frustrating return to 24
Shall we just give her a seat on the panel? #qanda
@ConnorPangallo1 You can't rehabilitate dead men. Death penalty is not justice for victims either. #qanda
Death penalty: Ineffective waste of money and, of course, life #ujcomm2657 @QandA #QandA
#qanda the war on drugs is lost regardless. Will killing these boys help at all....certainly not.
Tanya is choosing her words very carefully tonight #qanda
#qanda Wow ! The refugees are getting a raw deal than drug pushers ! Wheres our priorities ??
@QandA they did the crime. That's not in question #qanda
This girl has had a lot of air time #qanda
to that chick talking right now: newsflash - there is no justice here in australia either #qanda @qanda
#FreeWestPapua  #qanda
If it is on principle, then we should apply the same potential action to the USA, not just Indonesia. #QandA
#Qanda if ur going to fight so hard for 2 Australians you should fight hard 4 all people on death row. Solidarity against the death penalty
They would prob b outta jail by now  RT @wolfcat: Imagine if the AFP had arrested the Bali 9 not just dobbed them in #QandA
No we are not going to declare war on Indonesia for 2 saintly drug dealers #qanda
@Kangaroo_Court how do you know? sorry, but sounds like total bullshit @QandA @NSWSupCt #auspol
Country which locks up children indefinitely lectures another on 'human rights' #qanda
#qanda why are people acting like no crime was committed. Criminals are subject to the relative jurisdiction of the country.
What about #MaryJane? Any appeal or reprieve for her? #qanda
@QandA @GuardianAus. Drug trafficers void their Human rights. Willing to execute by drugs for profit.
How about we put this chick on the panel? She clearly has more to say than anyone else. Curious who she is supposed to be lecturing #qanda
@QandA Ultimately this will be an Indonesian solution. Imposing an Australian solution will only create resentment.
The green labor boat people policy killed thousands...no protest there  #qanda
While the death penalty is barbaric, what our current government (and agreeing opposition) are doing to refugees is ongoing torture #qanda
There is no true deterrent of crime so what's the answer? #qanda
Isnt it hypocritical for the #deathpenalty  to 'strain' our relationship with indonesia but with the US its fine? #qanda #auspol
@JulianBurnside I'm surprised you're not blaming Abbott. You usually do. #qanda
But we're okay with sending asylum seekers back to countries that kill their own citizens? #qanda
Why is this woman taking so much air time on #qanda ? #getonwithit
Capital punishment should be called what it is: murder by government. #qanda
But is it our place to tell another country how to run their rule of law?  #QandA

Can we just do a prisoner swap? 2 blokes in Bali in exchange for the cast of The Real Housewives of Melbourne. #qanda
Love how Tanya shirks the tough question from Tony about the relationship with Indonesia. Typical Shadow Minister #QandA
The death penalty is a tool to create fear, not rehabilitation or justified punishment #qanda
Aiiieee! What's with the super-extreme close-ups?? It's horrible on a large screen TV! @QandA
#QandA it's not our country love!
Still wonder about the AFP decision to tell Indonesia rather than stop the #BaliNine leaving our shores. Are they accomplices #QandA
Look at all the crime in the US. Death penalty doesn't work #qanda

"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire". ~ Oscar Schindler #qanda

@QandA it's pointless debating the merits of the death penalty here. The show needs to be broadcast in Indonesia.

Did #qanda just break news? That was a moment.
A whole Twitter just for opposing the death penalty what a great idea. #qanda
#QandA Wododo can be seen as a powerfully respected leader by cancelling the executions..
@QandA If there was even the slightest taint of corruption in the judicial process, it should be rendered null and void. #qanda
#QandA No wonder #TaniaPlibersek is defending the #BaliNine. Her husband is a convicted #drug dealer. The #world needs to stand #strong.
#qanda the death penalty acts only as a deterrent to those who committed the crime and not the wider community!
No human has the right to take the life of another human @qanda #qanda
@QandA  They knew the risks, they went for the reward, they lost. They gambled with others lives as well as their own #qanda
#qanda The death penalty is quite simply barbaric
The notion of justice is inconsistent on a global scale. #qanda

Sad that they may be executed but has anyone asked family and friends of heroin addicts or those forced to traffic how they feel #qanda
Plenty of countries have inconsistent sentencing. Australia included. Take issue in all across the world or accept it. #qanda
Important to note that Australia's Grand Mufti - our highest Islamic authority - is currently in Indonesia calling for clemency. #QandA

You'd never find corruption happening in Australian bureaucracy. #QandA
The execution must be playing havoc with their families #QandA
That woman on #qanda is right about 'our' thoughts and policies on justice, but they didn't commit the crime here.
The death penalty doesn't deter criminals. It kills people who could potentially reform and improve the world around them. #QandA
Its time we changed the national conversation- Renewable energy&amp; agriculture can sustain our economy #auspol #qanda http://t.co/BoRo6SGFzh
#qanda what would the questioner have Australia do?

We have to be able to have faith in a non corrupt rule of law &amp; justice system @QandA #qanda
The answer is for Indonesia to transit to a better response to drugs that replaces the death penalty #qanda
For a decent society start at rule of law and build from there #qanda
#qanda punishing drug traffickers is not working, killing them doesn't work. Legalize it and tax the hell out of it
Murdering these men are not going to stop people from buying, selling or trafficking drugs. It's ridiculous. #qanda

@QandA if anyone supports what they're doing--on a@a twitter-- they are promoting their execution, maybe causing it, please don't.
@QandA we wouldnt have this problem is people didn't smuggle drugs in the first place #qanda
Joko &amp; his govt have repeatedly said they would not heed any constitutional challenge. Please be careful with this 'breaking news' @QandA
No future for Australia without a good relationship with Indonesia. Enough bad diplomacy from Australia. Don't threaten aid. #qanda
#qanda Indonesia are using the 2 Aussies to intentionally escalate bad relations with Australia. Don't worry about justice or sovereignty.
What a complete contrast to current PM. @tanya_plibersek too intelligent for Straya' we like dumb downunder #qanda https://t.co/pdD7cBFHJp
Unfortunately Australia can't intervene in    all unjust systems. We have enough trouble addressing problems in our own system #qanda
Yeah #qanda
Capital punishment is revenge dressed up as deterrence, perpetuated by some of the most corrupt justice systems in the world #qanda
Drug smuggling is a lifestyle choice #QandA

Finding it hard to read Indonesia, Jokowi uses populist rhetoric but we have another appeal. Genuinely don't know what will happen #qanda
It's certainly cruel, but we should stop arrogantly denouncing Indonesia as amoral or barbaric - it doesn't help #qanda
The death penalty is a useless act of consequence. The fact is it doesn't change anything.   #qanda
let's take a moment to think about how they got in this situation. Howard govt ring any bells?  #qanda
One of the most effective actions Australians can take is to not travel to Indonesia or buy Indonesian products #QandA

The change of mood caused by people getting to understand the humanity of the death row prisoners is thanks to friends esp @BenQuilty #qanda
2 aussies in indo.. or thousands of #refugees being tortured #qanda time for #refugee discussion
Selective outrage of our media, Indonesia committing murder,rape&amp;torture in West Papua every day yet 2 drug smugglers causes outrage #QandA
Indonesia sees our advocacy as borne of hypocrisy, only occurring when it's Australians in trouble #QandA
Remember drugs kill, so don't touch drugs. #QandA
Im afraid greed and trade will deter our government pushing  too hard to take hard measures against Indonesia @qanda
Regulation of these drugs removes the criminal element, reduces criminality. Observe Portugal. #qanda

Human Rights is universal, not a state or sovereign issue #qanda
What a beautiful situation where imminent deaths remind people the Westminster system makes a civil society. #qanda
#qanda we should abolish death penalty from this world
Indonesians are not responsible for the actions of their govt. Ridiculous to blame them #QandA
Sorry #qanda but that woman has had this platform another night. Time for others to speak about other topics of URGENT CONCERN.
do not give up. #qanda
Tanya Plibersek has had lots of air time already and said nothing. What a progressive hero, can't even say the death penalty's bad #qanda
#qanda why not show a similar passion and compassion for refugee asylum seekers that drown on our shores
#QandA They are not BOYS they are drug peddling scum.
#qanda slaughter of innocent west papuans is ignored whilst all this attention on those that broke indo law
Are Indonesians supportive of capital punishment? What do polls say? #qanda
Capital punishment isn't the answer. #qanda
Too little too late. Don't tell Indo how to run their country. And maybe don't commit crimes there either. #qanda
Yes lets reevaluate our relationship with a country whose military is 12x larger than our own. Smart. #qanda
We don't execute nearly enough people for stupidity. And given natural selection largely no longer applies to humans (at least in a #qanda

#QandA @QandA Inconsistency in sentencing renders Indonesia's processes null and voice. I for one will NEVER EVER go there
'Inconsistent application of justice' - this has been present in our society for such a long time. #qanda
I wonder if Australia has ever had civilians on America's death row.. and if the government threatened relations with the US over it. #qanda
@qanda Tim Fischer a man of real moral conviction.

Let's not forget this execution is against their laws of rehabilitation #qanda
#qanda #bali9 http://t.co/CP7lTd781K
How do people understand the notion of justice? Easy, don't commit crimes. #qanda
#qanda no drug trafficking if they're in jail, allow them to teach others for the rest of their lives!
It is very depressing, but I suspect public protest is likely to only strengthen the Indonesian government's resolve #qanda
#qanda @QandA What if Indonesia called on us to release people smugglers? How would we respond? Don't we respect judicial independence?
These boys only repented cos they were caught and nothing else to do for the last ten years.  Why did Indonesia take so long? #qanda
Perhaps we should foster a better relationship with Indonesia rather than lecturing them about boats. #qanda
So we are content to torture people towards madness in detention but balk at the equally barbaric justice system of other countries? #qanda
An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind #qanda
Two young men who have rehabilitated and are now playing an enormously important role in Indonesia  #QandA

I'm pathetically grateful to #Indonesia #qanda

Is anyone going to mention maybe the AFP should be subject to some changes in light of this? #Bali9 #qanda
Indonesia will go through with the execution of the two. #qanda
#QandA imprisoning indefinitely, turning back, destroys, drive insane. Savage. Ineffective
Don't forget the justice system of Australian that still locks up 227 #asylum seeker children in detention. #QandA
Some people in India have claimed that the death penalty is not a deterrent for rape, but the exact opposite (i.e. nothing to lose) #qanda
@australiaplus any danger of playing any of #qanda live tonight?
Last week #Qanda never touched on the #TPP.. This week the debate is on track...
Married and widowed in a week #qanda
My thoughts are with the Nepalese people... and the yetis. #qanda
@Gordicans You are right. #QandA
How about the punishments Indonesia imposed upon the Bali bombers? Some of those people are now free. Seems a bit imbalance. #qanda
Oops. Polls actually show majority support for death penalty in Indonesia #QandA
Feeling down cause my footy team lost ( Cats ) so I/m going to get more depressed &amp; watch #QandA ! #gocats
#QandA Jon Stanhope ACT Chief Minister at the time refused to deport a murder suspect to China because of their death penalty law
And hey #qanda if you want to learn about the injustices in our own Aussie 'justice' system, go check out the #JustJustice campaign
Maybe we should start hanging or shooting Indonesian's in jail here #qanda
#qanda @qanda passion is brilliant the panel is not an Indonesian jury
How dare Indonesia pretend to "teach" morality when their legal system is openly corrupt? @qanda #qanda
Tanya Plibersek and Arthur Sinodinos responding with great concern, caution and respect to these questions. #qanda
Tanya Plibersek is right Diplomacy diplomacy diplomacy #qanda
For Indonesia, this is about sending a message. If political intervention was going to work, it already would have. #bali9 #qanda
@QandA Wheres outcry4 One on death row in China? Why Do we not condem the death penalty in the USA? people who have lost loveones by drugs
#qanda I'm getting sick and tired of hearing about Bali 9 , they deserve what punishment the law gives them.  Not that I agree with it.

Another pathetic reaction from the LNP government! #qanda
Why is it that we always focus on Australians involved? Over 2,000 PEOPLE have died. #qanda
Because they're not white. #qanda
don't traffic drugs #qanda
How many women have died this year to dv compared to indos death sentence?  And funds spent on each? #qanda
Its been clearly demonstrated that we have very little control over Indonesian consistency in justice. #qanda @QandA
@JoeyWarriner Yes, exactly like the Gallipoli landing @mcintinhos #qanda
#qanda  can another country please tell us to stop treating refugees like criminals. Will we listen?
#QandA Hey Saudi Arabia beheads every day that we are allies with ! Don't hear anyone screaming !!!
Again highlights how we ignored the U.S. treatment of David Hicks #QandA
8.3kg of heroin could of killed a lot more than 2 people #QandA #respectthelaw
The short answer is: we've become a selfish country #qanda
Let's send the $100m for the French monument to Nepal. #qanda
Indonesia has objected to death penalty for its citizens in Saudi Arabia but insists on it for its own prisoners. Hypocrisy. #qanda #auspol
Can we be equally outraged by the killing of lesbians and gays in state sanctioned miser around the world? @QandA #qanda
Because Julie Bishop is a lizard #qanda
When, not if, they execute them, we cease foreign aid. Simple. Save us some money too #qanda
#qanda  the death penalty makes killers of us all.
Social research way back in the 1950s found that the death penalty doesn't deter. When will we listen? #qanda
We are busy funding the abc #qanda
Killing people doesn't actually solve anything: it just destroys the possibility of rehabilitation and retribution. #qanda  #ujcomm2657
The right to assert sovereignty &amp; not back down are such contemptible reasons to execute two rehabilitated young men #qanda #chansukumaran
The death penalty might not be the answer.  But perhaps it's about time drug dealers get the message #qanda
The health and worth of a state or country can be measured, I believe, by looking at how it treats its criminals. #qanda
#QandA This must be the most passionate questioner I have seen, good on her for the conviction to human rights and democracy!
Desmond Tutu: "To take a life when a life has been lost is revenge, not justice." #istandformercy #bali9 #qanda
Would Indonesia care of the fractured relationships between our countries should execution go ahead? The death penalty is outdated #qanda
Don't care about #qanda 2 drug mules the first story when 3700 people killed in a quake and a #RoyalBaby is on its way
#QandA we do a lot of trade with other countries that have the death penaltys
Decided not to travel to Bali again. #QandA
We're one of the wealthiest countries in the world. We can almost always do more #QandA
We don't have money for aid to Nepal. We're funding climate deniers #qanda
The fact we support laws that cause &amp; compound drug harm means all the talk about death penalty in Indonesia is just self indulgence #qanda
How about we send that questioner over as a replacement execution? Win-win for all who will never have to listen to her ramble again. #qanda
@QandA @tomporteous it's not savage if it removes murderers, rapists and pedophiles from our society.
Great question! We all should be asking this. #QandA
It's Indonesia's decision. Now why don't we help out Nepal and Turkey huh? #qanda @qanda
i don't support the #deathpenalty its to harsh of a sentence #qanda
We need to oppose the dp all the time, not just when Australians face it. Only through sustained support do messages resonate #qanda
@MsRedWriting I'm not sure Indonesia is ruled by Sharia law but would have to research #qanda
Australia's approach to the Nepali earthquake is embarrassing. 3500 people dead and we focus only on rescuing Australians. #qanda
#QandA Prefer $100 million be sent to Nepal instead of another war memorial in France
#qanda #ujcomm2657 whatever Indonesia chooses to do they must remain consistent in their sentencing!!
The conduct of the Federal police will never be forgotten #qanda including Mick Keelty.
Deeply disappointed by how @TonyAbbottMHR handled the #Bali9 issue. #qanda
@QandA #qanda Why focus now, it might be too late. Australia should have done it very early. #auspol
@TheFacillitator @QandA spot on.
Australia just sent them 5 million for aid #QandA

Tim Fischer, Iraq was a sovereign nation and we attacked them apparently to bring democracy to them... #qanda
Feel for the families of Chan &amp; Sukumaran. A further reprieve for both. What an emotional roller coaster. No good comes from killing #QandA
Australia must do more in Nepal. Our response has been a disgrace @QandA #QandA
"Why has the Australian Government not been more involved in sending supplies and helping the people of Nepal?" #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Australia's response in Nepal is beyond sickening. Heartless government and heartless people. #qanda
#QandA apparently we are too poor to assist the Nepalese..
Just a note that #Oxfam and #RedCross are both doing great work in Nepal and need donations #qanda
#qanda I love it how we always help other countries but never seem to help our own people.
Has Aus govt said to Indonesia we'll help lobby countries that are going to execute Indonesians if they stop capital punishment? #qanda

Australian govt more interested in saving Bali 9 pair than helping those suffering in Nepal #qanda
The Australian govermnet always starts out with an amount, and then adds more in the days following.  #QandA
@QandA #QandA Everyone makes mistakes. Death penalty is not the answer. We are all human and deserve equality human rights.
We've just spent $100M for a statue in France. Sorry, Nepal. #QandA
The death penalty may not be the answer, but 40+ years of the "war on drugs" has also been an abject failure. #QandA
Because foreign aid won't help the deficit #qanda
#qanda how would you like your child rape we need the death penalty here
The recent devastation in Nepal reminds us of the importance of foreign aid #qanda
Why don't you have fuckwit from the AFP on the panel if you're going to discuss Bali9? They're the ones who pulled the trigger. #QandA
#qanda @QandA this is still worth reading even if a tad old. What smart diplomacy with Indonesia would look like: http://t.co/5Bm9Ccv7cT

@LucyZelic Where's your support for @mcintinhos? The white people invaded your country too #qanda
Some Goodie-Goodie Australians acting as the ICAC of Indonesia on #QandA ....
The death  penalty is state sanctioned murder. No more, and no less. It has no place in any decent, humane society #qanda @qanda

$100million for museum about the dead of WW1, but none for today's suffering in #nepal #qanda

They did the crime and as such should face punishment. However execution is not the answer. #QandA #balinine
Is Mick Keelty watching #qanda tonight?
@Kangaroo_Court @QandA @NSWSupCt that makes it OK then. It's like saying ANZACS fight like ISIS, that's OK too.
If they  had been successful in their importation, how many Australian might have died? Law of the land applied. #QandA
Australia could increase aid to Nepal if stopped spending billions of dollars on offshore detention camps for refugees. #QandA
They did the crime now deal with the consequences. Plain &amp; simple. They don't deserve clemency. Tired of them being played as victims #qanda
Donations help much more than prayers #qanda
It is an embarrassment that we are not sending more aid to Nepal when they so desperately need it. #qanda
Because Australians only care about Australians #qanda
Tim Fischer, Iraq was a "sovereign nation" and we attacked them apparently to bring democracy to them... #qanda
Our aid response to #Nepal is hardly surprising against the backdrop of massive cuts to our foreign aid budget. #QandA
We cut our foreign budget by $7.6 billion over the next five years, now we're seeing the effect #QandA
@qanda #qanda So now you play party politics on #Nepal  Give Govt a chance to take a measured response. Don't kneejerk.
Let's send the $4m for the climate skeptic to Nepal. #qanda
What I'd give for a government that gave leadership roles to people like Tom. #qanda

Clearly anything tony abbot says is complete onion chowder, so don't ask for answers. There will only be confusion. #qanda
@QandA will U be asking about the #TPP tonight? would have been great while Robb was on tho

#qanda Absolutely agree @tanya_plibersek. Only 9 people is woeful.
short answer: Abbott and his pals would rather build a war memorial in france #qanda
$5m is a bit of a joke really. Not even 25 cents per Australian. #qanda
Death penalty is atrocious, but to claim it doesn't reduce crime can't be right. Certainly prevents repeat offenders. #qanda

This government has shown its priorities to us, and human welfare is not one of them. #qanda
We are so fortunate in Australia, we can properly afford to help those facing natural disasters! #qanda
Yeah #QandA
A lot of the money that's gone to Bali would've meant a lot of aid to Nepalese rescue #qanda
No. Do not #prayfornepal! Donate to charities that actually help! #qanda
The government needs to step up its aid to Nepal. Far too modest and not good enough. #auspol #qanda
#QandA budget emergency over, reinstate foreign aid.
We should do more; our help is modest. @tanya_plibersek talking about aid to #NepalEarthquake on #QandA #AustralianAid
Great question! As a country we need to do more to help the people of Nepal. #qanda
#qanda At the end of the day, tourists can go home. Traumatised Sherpas will have to return to their jobs.
Foreign aid stalled as Abbott wants contract to be conditional on getting veto over any future decisions of Nepalese justice system #qanda
First we talk about criminals. And THEN a humanitarian disaster? As Ron Weasley said, she needs to get her priorities sorted out. #qanda
We should send the army to Nepal not Iraq #qanda
It's the only response that a government as cold-hearted on foreign aid as ours is capable of. #QandA
"@newscomauHQ: #BREAKING: Indonesia court agrees to consider appeal on May 12 #QandA @QandA" #istandformercy #keephopealive
Morally weak of Australia to send emergency workers to Nepal to save only Australian lives. #qanda shameful
Where not providing support to Nepal because our government lacks empathy #qanda
#qanda easy for you to say to send money and aid but you aren't doing anything! All talk! No walk!
Use the east-west link road money!! #qanda @qanda
Far Out !!  Tanya goes straight to what she does best.  Play Politics with a tragic situation.  #Qanda She is a piece of work.
It's sad to see Australia becoming less and less involved in the global community #qanda
Many wailing about two facing death r avowed anti-nationalists. So why focus on Oz citizens? Why no rage at US executions too? #QandA
Plibersek diplomatically says Australian Govt Nepal donation "modest". Is donating less than 20 cents per Australian. #MegaModest #qanda
Those two continue to be emotionally tortured while still breathing. It's an act of gross inhumanity no matter what ones own view is. #qanda
Great question! We shouldn't only focus on helping Australians who suffered from the Nepal earthquake #QandA #ujcomm2657
@qanda How about we stop paying all our attention to the two drug smugglers and send our prayers to the 1700 in Nepal.
#QandA Aus govt should be sending army, orienteers, doctors etc to Nepal for humanitarian assistance, let's set a precedence
"Use the money spent on the Bali 9 and send it to Nepal" mother dearest #qanda @QandA
#qanda Our government is not known for helping where it is needed, just spending money on stupid things.
The process has been completely barbaric... They have been tortured enough already @QandA #qanda
Why are we not doing more in Nepal? because @TonyAbbottMHR cut #foreignaid, that's why. #qanda
"Downpayment"??? It's not a business transaction, it's people's lives #QandA #ujcomm2657
$5m for #NepalEarthquake. $100m for a war memorial in France. Government's priorities are clear. #qanda
#QandA  We live in a global village of earth and we must help each other
Let's not pray, let's act #qanda #NepalEarthquake
Don't pray for Nepal, send money, food &amp; clothes. Prayers don't work. #qanda
$4 million for a climate denier, $5 million for Nepal. #qanda
Capital punishment: expensive, ineffective and just plain hypocritical #qanda #ujcomm2657
$5M for Nepal.  $100M for a war monument in France.  Seems legit.  #qanda
Christian chaplains get $250m to go into government schools, Nepal gets $5m #qanda
@RowdyRobey really? Haha I turned off. #QandA
Australia must do more to support the people of Nepal #AustraliaAid #QandA
We have more than enough extra resources to redirect them to Nepal immediately #qanda
#qanda If Labor stopped blocking the Budget, we would be in a better position to do more re Nepal. Oh well..
How much leniency appeals do you want them to give Widodo???!!!! #bali9 #anixety #stress #qanda
How do you actually spend $100m on a war memorial? #qanda  what does it do that say a $10m one wouldn't?
@QandA this government doesn't believe in foreign aid #QandA
Why is it up to the government to fund Australia's conscience @QandA ?
Don't commit the crime in a country that has the death penalty, then you will not be subject to their justice: simples! #QandA
If the Australian government blow $150M on Anzac Day celebrations, it can afford to spend the same on search &amp; rescue ops in Nepal. #QandA
Disaster is 2 days old and people bagging the government already. Assess what is needed and then act...don't just throw money. #qanda
Would you rather $20m for Nepal to build from zero or $20m to make Australia better an be faster to help these causes in the future? #qanda
@BevanShields Hilarious you tweeted that before Arthur started speaking #auspol #qanda
#qanda Funny seeing Tanya continuing Opposition Leader audition continuing on QandA tonight.
We live in a global community now. Foreign aid is a necessity as a member of this global family. #qanda
#QANDA redirect all aid we give Indonesia to Nepal
$4 million for a climate denial centre in WA and $100m for a war memorial in France? $5m to Nepal. #QandA
Absolute tragedy in Nepal. We need to do more to help #qanda
Can we swap the $5m going to Nepal with the $100m going to 'celebrate our victories' in Villiers-Brettonneux? #qanda
After funding the Greens and their supporters, the government have no money left for Nepalese earthquake victims. #sad  #qanda
#QandA yes pray, but send money to Nepal too!
#qanda if you are really concerned about the death penalty why focus on 2 people when there are other Australians facing the death penalty?
#QandA RedCross will just lose your money in "admin fees"......give to anyone else
Let's send the $4m for bjorn Lomborg there.... Or you know anywhere else. #qanda
News long term support to rebuild well designed infrastructure. Such a poor country has little chance to do that alone. #qanda

How can we work with other countries? We voted for @TonyAbbottMHR #qanda
Our response is quite modest.  Nothing new for this mob. Tanya was being kind #qanda
Indonesia will not back out of the decision this late in the game. This is the chance to prove they have a tough stance on crime #QandA
The devastation in Nepal makes us realise how important foreign aid is. #qanda
Nepal is a nation that enjoys a big quota  of our tourists. #QandA
I'll give you a hint mate - they'll need more than $5m. #qanda
Going in blind, throwing money with no idea where it's most desperately needed is foolish. Find out where the money's best spent. #qanda
Sorry, Australia should be concentrating on helping the Solomon Islands. It is in our region #qanda
Only the liberal party could equate disaster relief as a "down payment" #qanda
It's great to see Professor Bunsen Honeydew back on  #qanda
Whatever happened to those jet fighter planes?  Let's send that money to Nepal #qanda
@QandA We must do more to help the beautiful souls of Nepal. A truly peaceful people in turmoil #qanda
@JulianBurnside That is the overarching elephant in the room.... #qanda #mercy #bali9 #hope #justice
Mmmkay! Sinodinus is sitting right there. The Elephant is not only in the room he's on the #qanda panel Does anybody have an #Icac question?
Do you have anything to give to Nepal, Arthur? #ICAC #QandA
Thank goodness it's Nth Hemi late spring and not the depths of winter #qanda
First question on #qanda, Tony Abbott not doing enough for Bali drug pigs. 2nd question, Tony Abbott not doing enough for Nepal. #FuckTheAbc
Let's just say it straight. Our govt mostly only cares about looking after ppl who can vote. #qanda
Australia is not well positioned for global support if a major disaster happens to us #QandA
Devastating to think the country that stole my heart is now in ruins. #QandA
Video questions are often the best  #qanda
Sidoninos can't even speak unequivocally on a natural disaster #qanda
@SparkCycles spot on! #qanda
Pretty sure it's the beginning and end of Australia's assistance. We have more important things to fund like submarines  #QandA
@yackheather @dodona777 @QandA exactly! What have we wrought?
Spending millions on monuments to memories. which would be better spent on aid  #qanda
Was the 5mil figure chosen because it was more than the Lomborg grant? #QandA
why are we so divided by borders? why is foreign aid even a discussion? we are one world. we are all human beings. #qanda @qanda
Don't just "pray" for Nepal. Actually do something helpful. #qanda
Would probably prefer aussie troops in Nepal right now and not Iraq #qanda
#QandA its a manifestation of negative politics - money for detention centres and war, not for aid
Unlike in our penal system, these boys have experienced a hard sentence and have been rehabilitated. How is this happening @QandA
more aid and support must be sent to nepal who will struggle long after this terrible earthquake #qanda
Australia - the stingey country #qanda
Rwandas doing better with aid than us at the moment #qanda
We should give the relief effort a catchy name: What you can du for Kathmandu? #qanda
Where is China's effort in Nepal? #qanda
Tanya making sure she doesn't further endanger the Bali pair #qanda
@cjpelican Australians only care about human rights when the affected are non-Indigenous people or refugees who don't arrive by sea. #qanda
@bobothecreepycl @QandA @NSWSupCt I never said it makes it OK. But you need to put it in perspective.

#qanda @QandA what is stopping Australia from giving andrew and myu diplomatic immunity to save their lives?
Abbots cuts to foreign aid shows just how much his party cares for others #qanda
Who gives a shit what other countries may or not be being to help. Roll up your sleeves Australia and get in there. Let's do more. #qanda
Q for @QandA is:More women have been killed by partners this week,same as every week.When will we seriously fund &amp; tackle this issue? #qanda
How many vigils will we hold for Nepal? #qanda
Expecting our government to do more to help the people of Nepal is hilarious considering our treatment of refugees #auspol #qanda
Whilst the events in Nepal are tragic, what about the declared disaster areas in NSW that is running into the 100's of millions? #QandA
Absolutely no disrespect to the dead.  i hate to think of themoney we are spending on MH380 vs helping the aid of potential survivors #qanda
Australians are SO generous, but why does it take an earthquake for our government to assist a country in poverty? @QandA #QandA
#qanda RE: Nepal, what Tony says &amp; what he does aren't the same. If he cared, he'd do something. If he won't, we can.
Join the Sydney FC bandwagon lads #qanda @qanda
I have grown fond of Sukumaran and Chan over the last several months. They've shown great dignity in a very difficult situation #qanda
Hey @TonyAbbottMHR, love thy neighbour #QandA #Nepal
$100m for a war museum, billions for Direct Action. Sorry Nepal, we just don't have the money. #qanda
@QandA @tomporteous wrong! the death penalty is %100 effective. the offender will never re-offend.
Once again, Australia using the "tyranny of distance" excuse to justify lack of aid #qanda
@QandA #qanda Great to see Arthur has got his memory back. Anyone going to ask him about political donations?
Abbott government's attitude towards any people "not from here" is pretty deplorable across the board, isn't it? #qanda #NepalEarthquake
Arthur has a company willing to help get water supply up and running, for the right price. #QandA
I don't want to sound controversial, but why don't we just invade New Zealand #qanda
The Abbott Government seems to want to take money away from helping those in other nations! #qanda
And what is the required Arthur?  @QandA #QandA
Redirect the funding of the chaplains program to the Nepal Crisis Disaster #qanda
@QandA Australian government certainly need to contribute more.
Apparently everybody agrees "Tanya is right" #qanda
I am sure our Government will help we are Aussies #qanda
Can't help the Nepalese when we are busy detaining innocent asylum seekers in offshore jails #QandA http://t.co/2LEDuKpcz7
Good point Mr Sinodinos. Nepal has lost a lot of World Heritage cultural sites in this disaster. #qanda
Seems to be time to remind people that we need a FEDERAL ICAC NOW!! @qanda #qanda #auspol
Isn't anything china's job? ...ever? #qanda #Nepal
"There is scope for us to do more", let's see it then. #qanda #ujcomm2657
Lives first. Buildings second #QandA #ujcomm2657
I don't support the death penalty but gee it is hard too up in arms about the execution of a couple of drug smugglers #qanda
Let's stop spreading the falsity that Australians are a generous people. #qanda
Gotta look out for our economy tho m8... can't just hand out aid to anyone, especially with out debt &amp; deficit #auspol #qanda @qanda
There is always scope for us to do more. Aust govt is so severely lacking in its international aid programs #NepalQuake #QandA
Pretty good answer, no need to just pump cash in before you know what is actually needed #QandA
Stop cutting funds to foreign aide budget @qanda #qanda
Cutting foreign aid will cause more disasters in the future. Increase aid for disaster risk reduction #qanda
Australians can donate via the Australian Himalayan Foundation https://t.co/WQKx6HNntf #QandA
Why can't Australia prioritise emergency aid for overseas disasters? Other first-world countries do just this. #QandA
#qanda 5 mill for Nepal. 100 million for France war monument   Not good enough.
#qanda Until the US, leader of the free world, ends capital punishment we're fighting a losing battle.
#qanda  sinodinos red herring about rebuilding
#qanda Abbott is making a $4m movie on asylum seekers &amp; $4m for climate denier to do research on climate change. No money left.
We need to think about rescuing people before we think abut restoring buildings!  #QandA #Nepal
#Abbott gives 40 million to #Cambodia in "aid money" to dump a few dozen #refugees there.  5 million to #Nepal with 3000+ deaths #qanda
This is why Labor should not be in charge of our money. Plibersek's comments astounding #qanda
We must support the people of #Nepal with medical aid and food supplies! Get donating Australia! #qanda #ujcomm2657
Breaking News on #qanda that Chan &amp; Sukumaran have been granted a judicial hearing on May12th! Great news!
Plibersek 4 PM #qanda
How does Democracy work? Bag the opposition for not doing enough. Another global catastrophe politicised. #QandA
Put Lamborg money to good use donate to Nepal @QandA #NepalEarthquake
So with 2000 less mouths to feed in Nepal, does this make foreign aid more affordable now? #qanda
#qanda Buildings can be replaced. Human lives can't.
$5m to Nepal natural disaster aid.... $4m to climate change "contrarian" research.... hmmm #QandA
Sinodinos can help rebuild Nepal with his water infrastructure expertise, only $200k for 25 hours #qanda
#qanda Order for death of #Bali9 "ringleaders" isn't to do with crime It's corrupt illusion of power of sovereign rulers at a point in time
@JasminaMarkulic @QandA Yeah 'cause prayers help like money or experts on the ground.
#stopStateTerrorism and the murder of people in custody #rezabarati we want #justice for people in custody #JusticeForFreddieGray #qanda
*aims for #qanda hot tweet* *checks notes*
#PrayforNepal does nothing to fix the damage. We need to pay for, not pray for aid #QandA
@MartinPribble Or perhaps the cause of rape murders... No witness, no charge, no conviction, no death penalty. #qanda
We need to stop spending money fighting wars for the U.S. and start spending money to help #qanda
#QandA foreign aid building in France instead of Nepal. Wonder where it's needed most?
Let's worry about the people before the buildings #qanda
Sorry I can't take a single word that comes out of Arthur's mouth seriously. I'm sure it's all lies. Why should I believe otherwise? #qanda
Maybe foreign aid ear marked for Indonesia can be re-prioritised and given to Nepal?  #QandA
I suppose we should grieve for Nepal #QandA #auspol
Thinking of the families of the victims and also for the missing australians and their families #qanda
We will be generous to the Nepalese, as long as none of them try to come here asking for protection #QandA
Modest? Didn't know modest was a synonym for miserly. #qanda
Once we were known for our generosity. Once. #qanda
The prudency of how aid is supplied is just as important as the amount of aid provided. #QandA
Australian government needs to get it's act together and step up aid for Nepal #qanda
From memory, not uncommon for Aus Govt to start with 'modest' financial figure, and then up it later when need identified. #qanda #Nepal
Fuck me dead. I think they need basic services before restoring historical buildings fuckwit. Sheesh #qanda
#QandA http://t.co/iPsVixaxbC
Increase in defence spending and decrease in active operations. Send #ausmil to #Nepal? #QandA
#QandA We have to pay for more of those jet fighters that still haven't materialised, we don't have money to aid
"First World country" talk the talk of colonialism #qanda
We aren't only Australian, we are also human. Seeing other humans in strife should be all the motivation we need to send aid #qanda #ujcomm
Let's hope we give to Nepal in accordance with their needs. #qanda
Think we are more worried about people rather than buildings right now Arthur  #qanda
"First world"? Eh? #qanda
the death penalty is political Viagra for flaccid politicians #qanda
@BevanShields No. She is calm, considered &amp; doesn't fall victim to over the top rhetoric. Big difference to being boring. #qanda
$5mil is NOTHING. #qanda
Israel has already sent teams to help #NepalQuake #qanda
#qanda #UJCOMM2657 Australia could have donated over 600 million to Nepal if it was not wasted on two governments playing chicken re a road
Focus on reacting to immediate need, look at longer term #qanda
$5 Mil is not enough   @QandA #QandA
#qanda imagine if we harnessed as much energy on closing the gap as we have on the debate about due process for men who knowingly broke law
We should count ourselves lucky that we don't get massive earthquakes here. #QandA
Why waste money in France when Nepal needs it?? @QandA  #qanda
I don't think anyone buried under those buildings could care less about the restoration of them... #qanda
Wtf are they going to kill people and then conduct a hearing afterwards #qanda
@qanda If there was an earthquake in the US, would the figure still be $5m?
Some money up front is better than nothing. Other countries now need to chip in and help! #qanda
Who? #qanda  https://t.co/PsOjR7HkGT
US have only promised $1m in aid whereas Australia has given $5m. #QandA
@AnthonyForsyt10 It seems to be in The Independent, but not yet confirmed by Indonesian authorities. http://t.co/65WnkzQ5rK #qanda

Tanya Plibersek proves yet again her calm, measured nature on the go as news breaks. Leadership qualities #qanda https://t.co/NjJlpaUsLx
#qanda Typical labor logic,throw everything in at any cost, then assess later.Better to assess quickly then provide what is actually needed
We gave a billion to Indonesia but we want it back now that they will shoot the heroin dealers  #qanda
TPlib 4 PM. #Qanda
Good thing all those prayers for Nepal are tangible and can help. Unlike funding for relief or medical assistance. #qanda
the judges in their case admitted they never wanted the death penalty for the boys @QandA #qanda
#qanda see what Australia offered post tsunami in arche.
What happens to all those temples that were destroyed? Do we just loose all that history? #ujcomm2657 #qanda
#qanda Plibersek - we should do more. $5m is pretty modest  remember Krudd during Pakistan floods - world's worst humanitarian disaster?
Why don't we speak about the West Papua problem ? #Qanda

I think we need to concentrate on the people right now. Let's worry about historic buildings later. #QandA
Top class engineering that this government is crushing. #qanda
Sinodinos, it's not about bricks and tourist attractions, it's about lives, healthcare, food, water and wellbeing. #QandA
People from all over the world sent gloves for burnt koalas - we can send some more aid to Nepal, surely! #qanda
Nepal's earthquake "victims" are leaners. Need to stand on their own two feet, pull themselves up by bootstraps #qanda
Too much rhetoric. Help Nepal. Full stop. #qanda
Arthur could donate some of his money from AWH #qanda
I'm more worried about the people Arthur! #qanda

This is the best #qanda panel in a while.
"First world country" oh FFS we're in 2015, not the cold war. #qanda
#QandA Tanya is the epitome of grace and respect in her comments on tragedy
@meerafernandes You absolute legend!! Brilliant question!! #qanda
Seriously?! Nepal's govt has called for aid to be CO-ORDINATED, not knee-jerk, like these arm chair humanitarians are demanding. #qanda
#qanda Buildings already? They need water. #nepalearthquake
You can't just throw money at the problem the Nepalese disaster needs to be assessed and money spent in the right place @QandA
#QandA Nepal is not a poor natoin
Those without mercy are scarily righteous #Bali9 #qanda
Arfur, lets not worry about contracts to rebuild Nepal just yet, lets contribute a bit more to help out first, eh? #qanda
I don't just want the public to be generous I want the government to be generous. #qanda
Our response in Nepal is a product of the governments priorities... not being a good global citizen right up there! #auspol #qanda
#qanda Arthur- let's worry about the buildings later. Let's help Nepal now!
1st two stories show how mankind can be simultaneously cruel and highly caring #qanda
@QandA @tomporteous Is a rectum
Good thing Nepal didn't have any Aussies on death row. I doubt the government would have sent any $$ if so. #qanda
We can do both. Help the Aussies on death row AND help the Nepalese. #QandA
Maybe if we paid the $5 GP co-payment we'd be in a stronger budgetary position to donate more ! We can't pay less and expect more.. #qanda
Don't worry about the buildings at the moment, let's get in contact with all of the Australians #qanda
Thank You Q&amp;A #QandA
oh dear.. imagine if there are refugees from nepal...what do we do? #qanda free the #refugees
What about the Nepalese who come to Australia via boat fleeing the disaster which just struck them? Will we help? #qanda
#QandA Israel on Sunday sent a medical staff of 122 doctors and, who also carried 95 tons of humanitarian and medical supplies.And more...
We have the money and resources. Just send it over. No Australian would argue against sending much more than $5 million. #qanda
#qanda isn't 5 million a lot from a small country of 20 million people? perplexed
#qanda our performance with foreign aid is dismal.
Foreign aid cuts were so disgusting. Sinodinos should be ashamed. #QandA
Stingy #nepalearthquake response and a $1b cut to #AustralianAid meaning countries will find it harder to become self-sufficent #qanda
There are yachts that cost more than $5mil #qanda
So with 3000 less mouths to feed in Nepal, does this make foreign aid more affordable now? #qanda
#qanda if you support drug smuggling maggots, you are a maggot
Create a departure tax to Indonesia and send money to Nepal #qanda
If Chan and Sukamaran escaped the prison and came to Oz by boat to escape penalty how long would the spend on Nauru? #qanda #auspol
@QandA foriegn aid is for everyone, unless you are dying from Ebola, a refugee, or foreign.....
Pretty hard to offer foreign aid when your budget guts about a fifth of it. #qanda
Why do we need to "assess the situation" when we can clearly see Nepal is in crisis and needs more help now? #qanda
Only looking after Australiansa after this devastation is so selfish. #qanda
Concern that tourists won't return to Nepal for some time, causing further damage #qanda
@QandA #qanda Does Hockey still think we should limit overseas aid? Sorry Nepal, we care more about our budget!!
Why can't Australia balance both issues and put the same amount of effort into the Bali 9 and Nepal cause?? #ujcomm2657 #qanda
I feel like architecture isn't the chief issue at this stage #qanda
@QandA #qanda my friend is in there. He was 1.5 he from Everest base. All help to get all ozies out

We're so generous and $5 million is a good start. We can afford it yet we're the least generous we've ever been #goodaidworks @QandA #qanda
That's stupid Arthur. Nepal needs help to get back on her feet. The historic temples will be rebuilt later.  #QandA
@QandA @tomporteous of course, it is murder by the State.
@QandA #QandA i heard a rumour that Mt Everest is no longer the tallest mountain in the world.
Why don't we challenge the use of the death Penalty in the US? #qanda
#QandA great point Arthur but need to send more money as well as the manpower to help in Nepal
#qanda we can do better than our meagre initial $5M but we did better than the yanks at $1M
20% of this government's budget savings have come from #AustralianAid #qanda
On top of the traditional architecture at risk in Nepal, we need to act on the destruction of history occurring at the hands of IS #qanda

Forget the people, won't somebody think of the BUILDINGS?!? #QandA
Let's be clear this is the government that eviscerated foreign aid #QandA

How about those 2 on death row consume all the heroin they tried to import &amp; if they survive that then let them live #qanda
So, it takes a disaster for Australia to get back to where our aid funding used to be? #QandA
We are a nation with much and should be offering a lot more to those with little - like Nepal. #QandA
The terms 'first world' and 'second world' are archaic and should be retired #qanda
@tanya_plibersek you are outstanding. #qanda
@MWhalan What question? @mcintinhos is a fool :( @QandA
@QandA #QandA How about, scrap Captain Abbott's French Folly, and put $100mill to the Nepal effort.
@QandA Arthur Sinodinos lecturing about equal application of law is laughable
Foreign aid shows our generosity, we are not as generous as we used to be! #qanda
Our humanity should never be compromised for a budget bottom line, we should never cut foreign aid #qanda
#qanda and the AFP is silent on the issue of the Indonesian two, and their silence has been deafening...
.@tanya_plibersek says Australia's Nepal response is quite modest compared to the scale of the disaster #QandA http://t.co/UgNGMPUIjv
@QandA $5m to Nepal ... $4m to the climate change muppet. My brain hurts. #qanda
Earth is home. Charity begins and ends on earth #Qanda
We should invest in aid, not bombs. IMHO. #QandA
#qanda. Look at Australia's pathetic response to Ebola, didn't respond till pressured.
Lucky for the Libs that Nepal isn't known for its boats #QandA
Will the govt be prepared to take in Nepali refugees? Probably not. #qanda
Sinodinos talking about building at this stage. I am amazed for such lack insight. $5m  Same as wecut in budget. Much less France.  #qanda
Donate to World Vision who have a program to protect children displaced by the quake from predators. #QandA
Thought we should just leave it to the free market #qanda
Love how dodgy dude Arthur Sinodinos is lecturing us on morality...classic! #qanda
Arthur! It's not about buildings! Nepal needs water reticulation, sanitation, food #qanda
To those who believe charity begins at home: The world is our home. #QandA
What about shelter, water, basic services before worrying about cultural appropriateness in buildings #qanda #NepalEarthquake
Can't spend too much money on Nepal when pollies are busy lining their pockets. #qanda
Tanya making sure she doesn't further contribute to endangering the Bali pair #qanda Tony Jones could learn a thing or 2 from Tanya
#QandA $5M slightly better than China's miserly $3M...
We don't just need to offer money, we need to offer skills, rebuild for future stability #qanda
#qanda I think the volcanos erupting in Chile were a warning for the other side of the pacific about imminent movement in the earths crust
#QandA Want to do more for #Nepal? To donate to UNICEF: http://t.co/8taDz6puYY; to Save the Children: http://t.co/T7XF6Oj8oH.
We need to do more. $5 million is what they pay two football players. qanda
#QandA We can walk and talk at same time - but we need to be transparent &amp; honest.
Many Aussies love Nepal and will give generously to restore it. #qanda
Perfect example of why we need to continue our foreign aid programme. #qanda
#qanda Arthur: Police and rescue are "at a loss"? Have you seen the roads in Nepal in the best of times? They can't get in
Why rehabilitate prisoners and ensure they become productive members of society only to murder them- that's barbarism #qanda
Cut 20% of foreign aid.... You give what you get Australia... #qanda @QandA
anybody else think tanina sounds like she's about to cry? #qanda
Peeps on #QandA are quick to attack &amp; demand answers. You can't save the world! Chill out and worry about yourself and who YOU can control!
We consistently seem to focus solely on Australian life in disasters which effect the international community. Life is life. #qanda
The West is always relieving overseas diasters. Where are the Saudi petro-dollars to Nepal? #qanda
We can't squander our money on foreign aid so it can get squandered by corrupt governments #qanda
@suzanne2222 SocialMedia is place 4 people voice their opinions &amp; understanding without censorship MSM pumps out propaganda #auspol #qanda
@QandA does foreign aid include prisoners in bali
#QandA drop the $100m 4 a monument send to napal
#QandA -  Why not cancel the joint military exercises with Indonesia and give the money to Nepal?
LNP links aid to trade.  #qanda
So why then do we need an embassy to the Vatican? #qanda
#qanda our plea should not be only confined to the our duo but to also to lobby the lives of the remaining seven.

Australia's foreign aid budget is woeful. There will be more needed for the consequences of poverty and climate change #QandA
@QandA @tomporteous Agree on both counts. Sanctioned murder makes us worse than the criminals we are punishing. #WorldPeaceNow ^_^
We should help Tibet of course, but it's  funny that NOW China doesn't REALLY care about the region #qanda #FreeTibet
Difference between the Aid Budget as a tiny little issue nobody cares about, and Aid to Do Something about a current media event #qanda
#NepalQuakeRelief needs to be squillions #qanda
@QandA  foriegn aid is for everyone, unless you are dying from Ebola, a refugee, or foreign..... #qanda
Nepal needs help and we're not doing enough #qanda
Why wait for government? If you have the means donate direct yourself #QandA
#qanda Tim Fischer talking sense. Which is weird for a Nat!
OHHH just fuck off Tim #qanda
5millions to help the living. 100 million to build a memorial to the dead in France.  Unbelievable.  @QandA #qanda
Our current offer of help to Nepal is embarrassing #qanda

To think Tony Abbott spoke at Gallipolli about the importance of 'selflessness and moral courage'. #QandA
@QandA Tim Fischer is right. This is a matter for the Indonesian Government. We should not be meddling in legal affairs of Sovereignty.
Use the money we are spending on searching for a long lost plane. Send it to Nepal for the living. #qanda
Our contribution to Nepal is pitiful. We CAN and MUST do more!! #qanda
#qanda how about removing all aid to Indonesia and giving it to Nepal
#qanda Nepal deserves and needs more help than $5 million.
The LNP government are really mean-spirited! #qanda
I do agree we need more embassies. #qanda
Cancel the contract for the monument in France. I'd prefer my taxes help the Nepalese. #qanda
I would much rather the $150m for the museum at Villers-Bretennoux  be diverted to Nepal. #QandA
If Australia can afford two-thirds of a billion dollars for the Anzac centenary surely we can send more money to help #ujcomm2657 #qanda
@mcintinhos White people are bad #qanda
Arthur Sinodinous's appearance on #qanda must mark the beginning of testing the waters for his return to the Coalition front bench.
5 million pledged by the Australian government to Nepal; the result of AusAID -&gt; WasAID #qanda
Go Tim!! Nails it: more Dfat embassies needed for Australia's national interest #qanda
I hope the Bali 2 arent executed. We don't have the death penalty and the govt seem to be doing all they can...what are we debating? #qanda

5 million really doesnt stretch far these days, Cmon Aus Gov, get your act together and help get the aid to Nepal!! #QandA #AusPol
#qanda Will Julie Bishop require value for money for any aid given to Nepal. $5m is about what's been cut in aid @QandA  @14luxor
You've always struck me as a man of integrity Tim Fischer. #QandA
That is appalling, we are only putting back in about what we have cut from aid to Nepal. We are an international embarrassment #qanda
Charity begins at home but it doesn't end at home #qanda
Five million dollars could buy a nice house on the coast. Send more money. #qanda
They are talking about saving buildings , let's focus on saving people first #qanda
Abbott Govt's budget cuts to aid are a national disgrace #QandA
I don't understand why a country would murder people in the name of 'justice' when nature doesn't discriminate #qanda
Good on Tim Fischer, pointing of the consequences of cutting embassies &amp; foreign aid #QandA
Australia is a member of the Global Village, we need to pull our weight by helping Nepal...it seems disproportionately low per capita #qanda
Does Nepal know that if we give them aid Abbott will expect them to do what he wants indefinently? #auspol #qanda #ausaid
@QandA cut Indonesian aid for a year and give to Nepal !

every human life is equal, we share a common humanity. $5mil is a good start, lets see some more generosity from our government #QandA
5 million dollars to Nepal..  Didn't we just spend tens of billions of dollars on military jets we don't need?  #qanda
#qanda Tim Fischer titled as Vietnam  Veteran?
Nepal does not sell nor buy anything to Australia. So let us not waste money in aid. Let mighty India do it all! #QandA
#qanda The complete quote is "charity begins at home but doesn't end there." Nepal needs help. $5M in aid is a poor effort.
@Misty__Bella @mcintinhos @QandA anything he likes
.@TonyAbbottMHR  could defund that idiot climate-sceptic. That's $4 million available straight up. #qanda
Spare a thought for the hard-working @dfat people all around the world #qanda

Our government should give aid to Nepal and very little to Indonesia #qanda
#QandA if we can't help others less fortunate than us then we need to take a bloody good loo at our selfs
#qanda I do like Tim Fisher. Don't always agree with him but he seems honest &amp; fair minded. I agree with him on embassy presence.
#qanda Thank you, Tim Fischer!
#qanda this is what happens when the govt cut foreign aid budgets. We need to share our relative wealth with countries in need
Flavour and character? Nepal is a country of people, not a bottle of red wine to be appreciated.. #qanda
NZ has a team ready to go, so why has Australia been so slow #qanda
#qanda hypocrisy of Australia's position on the death penalty is gawling. And we do love duplicitously lecturing world on human rights
100M can be spent on a war memorial, but 5M for Nepal!! Another "captains call"? #qanda

Here's a clue: LISTEN TO THE LOCALS AND DON'T TRY TO WESTERNISE THE PLACE! @QandA #qanda
Australia cannot gain anything from Nepal, hence the very low amount of aid. #auspol #qanda
$4 million dollars for a climate denier, $100 million for a statue in France, yet we have a budget "emergency" and can't help Nepal #qanda
Foreign aid cuts were absolutely disgusting. #qanda
Eh? Was someone saying close the embassy? #qanda
Let's call it for what it is. The oz gov can't be seen to be helping the Nepalese people too much too quickly in front of China #qanda
The elephant in the #qanda room. Australia's aid budget is a complete disgrace.
Where will they find the funding for the embassies? #budget2015 @qanda #qanda

Our treasurer doesn't seem to be earning his wage ... let's donate his salary to the Nepalese #qanda
@QandA the government could make a human aid contribution and then offer citizens a tax deduction to replace that money to government
Aus gov welcomes international investment when it comes to financial gain but are far less interested when it comes to financial aid #QandA

Here here Tim Fischer - the Aus embassy in Kathmamdu doesn't even have a visa function. It's outsourced to India! #qanda
@qanda #qanda  You need the spare cash to give aid  $5mil is just the start - there will be more.  ABC is  Liberal bashing already.
We are big enough to maintain embassies &amp; fortunate enough to provide genuine aid. #qanda

True That! RT @Doclach: Few in Australia are better 'qualified' on the scenario of the #Bali9 than @tanya_plibersek #QandA #mercy #auspol

If you feel bad about what happened in Nepal, go help. Sitting and complaining doesn't help. #qanda
The same people complaining about foreign aid are the same ones whining about 457 visas #qanda
This Govt will want to test public sentiment on more aid to Nepal based on response to first question #qanda
the most important thing about Nepal is Australian victims #qanda
@Misty__Bella @mcintinhos @QandA I think he was broadly 'anti all war' but his statements were historically inaccurate.
Nepal infrastructure needs fixing. People will need long term trauma counselling #qanda

$100 million for a building in France, $5 million so far to Nepal but a  woman's son is a 'burden' to the tay payer #gofigure #QandA
Tim Fischer says we need an adequate embassy network and people on the ground in Nepal #QandA http://t.co/1h9h80nhWB
no Arthur #AustralianAid only accounts for 1% of govt expenditure. How is it sending you broke? #qanda
can we send Sir Prince phillip to Nepal as our representative? #qanda
We need an aid budget which matches our wealth, position, and the fact that we are rich because we exploit others' poverty. #qanda
Dear god I hate the habit of responding to criticism with "well the other side did it too so it must be ok" #QandA
#qanda how about we worry about natural disasters in our own country like last weeks floods in the hunter valley !!!
@GregBarila @AndrewJaffrey @GlenHunting QandA not only source reporting it as "breaking" -- appears to be new tonight??
Free West Papua ! #qanda
@QandA #qanda Could we send Christopher Pyne to Nepal? He's a fixer, you know. A win/win?
Let's put 4 million dollars into a "Nepal Aid Consensus Committee" #auspol #qanda @QandA
Let's not debate which government pledges more...JUST DO IT!!! #QandA
Plibersek: refreshingly measured and diplomatic responses to very contentious issues. Top class. #WatchTheThrone  #QandA
#qanda is this part of Sinidinos' community service?
Fucking hell. "Both Labor and the LNP have cut aid budgets" - LNP fool. LABOR DOING SOMETHING DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT, IDIOT. #qanda

Tim to Tony: When cutting the fat, don't cut DFAT #qanda
Nepal has the most beautiful people, this earthquake is tragic #qanda
Instead of debating how both major Parties have cut foreign aid, increase the aid to what will be helpful! #qanda
Tanya squealed about ebola aid What head UN said about #Auspol help? #QANDA #perthnews She needs to wind her neck in https://t.co/3n3zybh37t
We could take the money for the anti climate change centre in WA and send that to Nepal #qanda
Labor reclassified foreign aid, and other creative accounting tricks #qanda
#qanda @QandA Tony Abbott PM just gave $16million to Cadbury. Joe Hockey told us to tighten our belt.
Australian #foreignaid has shrunk under this government Nepal &amp; other nations are in need. We must accept our global responsibility #qanda
If you had to form a national govt with decent people from both sides this #qanda panel would be on it.
@QandA if u do the crime u do the time. They fully knew the implication of what they were doing. They accepted the risk. Now pay the price.
#qanda Labor doubled the aid budget, all of it borrowed
#qanda Don't do the statue in France!  Or make 5 mill do for that and give the 100 mill to Nepal
@meerafernandes @QandA they did! Good to see you on TV asking how Australia will help #Nepal #QandA http://t.co/c8qppmik8I
'Cuts in the aid budget was a fundamental era' CORRECT! #qanda #auspol
Let's talk about the spending Tanya. #qanda
Australia's aid contribution is a global shame #QandA
Underlying racism can be detected  here. We only care about Australians. Here's a penny for your thoughts, Nepal #QandA
@QandA #qanda ask Sinodinus if the North Sydney Forum could contribute
@QandA #Qanda Tony please address questions for the government to the minister, not those in opposition.
#Qanda Will the Lomborg concensus centre work on the benefits and effectiveness of foreign aid?
Is Australia the Gina Rinehart of the international community? #QandA
Foreign aid should not exceed the $ spent on Australian disasters...where is the drought funding for farmers? #qanda
Oh those pesky poor people and their disasters, getting in the way of our GDP. Can't they see how important it is? #QandA
This government has taken the aid budget away from where it's needed overseas to where it's not needed on sydney's north shore. #QandA
These are such frequent events now, why don't we have an organised international response that all UN members support? #qanda
Why the govt?. Everest travel agents should be kicking in 20 times more #qanda
Oh Arthur. Did you cut money from business subsidies on your search to get in the black? No. You cut services. Thats in your DNA #qanda
Foreign aid is needed to build resilience over time, as well as to provide remedial assistance in the aftermath of disasters #qanda
Cutting foreign aid helps no one and has detrimental effects on everyone #qanda
Plibersek for prime minster #qanda
$1bn cut - 20% - from #AustralianAid will have disastrous consequences in Nepal and  elsewhere #qanda
It's under this government that #Foreign Aid in 2016 will be the equivalent of our aid in 1960.  Shameful.  11 billion cut.  #qanda
If we ever go into civil war God help us #qanda
Start taxing churches and use their funds for foreign aid #qanda
Embarrassing aid budget - $5M to Nepal is a shocker This massive selfish cut will hurt AUS influence in years ahead #auspoI #qanda
@tanya_plibersek - never lose the faith. #QandA
Children need to see their country giving to others that need it more. Restore the #foreignaidbudget #nepalearthquake #qanda
I'll be reevaluating MY relationship with Indonesia - I urge all Australians to do the same #qanda
So many westerners have enjoyed life-changing moments in Nepal and on Mt Everest. Now is their chance to give something back. #qanda
I hope everyone watching #qanda is putting their hand in their pockets for #Nepal not just talking about what they need.
The facts on the foreign aid budget #qanda http://t.co/3MufRPTd0q
Sinodinos Classic, blame labor straight away. Standard lines from an Abbott govt member. #qanda
Foreign aid is a necessity not a luxury.  Simple as that. #qanda
Just as many Nepalese workers have died in Qatar building World Cup stadia. #Qanda
#QandA @QandA All "fluff funding" should be removed and diverted to natural disaster aid. This includes government superannuation.
Our smallest debits on the BOP are secondary incomes aka foreign aid.....pitiful #ujcomm2567 #QandA
How do you cut $11b from $5.8b? I'm totally confused #qanda
Our government's aid spending is the lowest it's ever been - thanks to both parties #QandA #goodaidworks
Those are some staggering cuts. Australia, you should be embarrassed. #QandA
Perhaps as Australia's attention is now so firmly on Indonesia it is time to extend our gaze to human rights concern in #WestPapua #qanda
@tanya_plibersek Vanuatu communities still without basic needs being met post TC Pam. Can Australia do more? #QandA http://t.co/HzpRoBZKw5
It's time to stop calling it foreign aid and start calling it what it is , human aid !! #qanda
Everyone wants to talk about Anzac. #qanda
Heart goes out to those in Nepal- foreign aid is a necessity for this already struggling nation #QandA #ujcomm2657
We should be ashamed of the cuts to our foreign aid,. We are far wealthier than Nepal. #QandA
Is Jakarta now trying to bury their news of the day on Australia's budget day? #12May #qanda @QandA
Had the pleasure of doing a writers' festival session with Tim Fischer. Wise and good man. #qanda
LNP budgeteers are the MOST greedy people ever in our parliament. #QandA #AusPol @QandA
don't we need to help ourselves at the moment before others?? #qanda
And now, sadly, Nepal becomes a political football concerning aid. Talk about Nepal. #qanda
@QandA good articulate fella is Tim. All party's need more facimilies.
WHAT $11 Billion ??  @QandA #QandA
Cop that Sinodinos, you flavourless, stone cold destroyer of the fundamentals of a humane society. #QandA
Arfur Sinodinos won't endorse foreign aid commitment unless he gets a 10% commission? #qanda
#QandA help and love thy neighbor
Govts of both persuasions cut foreign aid because they know plenty of voters hate money going to brown people. #qanda
We always talk guilt, government and broad perspectives. Why don't we think 'what can I do myself, today, now? #QandA
To put it in perspective, NZ, with 15% of Aus population has pledged $1 million (20% of Aus pledge) to Nepal. #qanda
When did Arty Shonkydinis get his memory back?  #Disgrace #ICAC #QandA
Cutting $11 billion from the Aid budget is an absolute joke #qanda #ujcomm2657
#qanda you doubled it tania all borrowed #cheers @QandA
#qanda when it comes to helping people in crisis money shouldn't be a issue
Only 15 minutes into  #qanda and already it is all Labor's fault, according to Sinodinos.
#qanda I'm sure that Tim Fischer is more than a Vietnam veteran. Much more.
How about people donate the equivalent  amount from their negative gearing to Nepal? There is the difference #qanda
#QandA the immediate recovery is spurred on by shock, what about in 5 years time?
For fuck sake.  India and China are neighbors of Nepal.  Let them sort it out.  Why does Aust have to pay for every fricking disaster #qanda
Plibersek. Always awesome #qanda
I'm so grateful to live in this country and I want to use the tax I pay to help the less fortunate #qanda
@QandA @tanya_plibersek. We need to give much more immediately to save lives.
#qanda  "All the childern in detention will be released by Christmas!"  What happened to this promise @TonyAbbottMHR ?
@QandA stop searching for the missing plane and use the money for the living
The foreign aids cuts have absolutely no bearing on the current discussion. It matters what happens now. #qanda @QandA
Take a pay cut then tanya!!! #qanda
This govt has shown itself to be merciless #qanda
#qanda Redirect Tony Abbott to Nepal - please
@QandA why are we talking about aid for overseas how about NSW?
Donate to Nepal here #qanda  http://t.co/JOGKkBE3R2
I'm surprised Sinodinos can recall anything at the moment. Horrible memory lapses #qanda #icac
Arthur Sinodinos is the last person I'd be trusting with money flows. #qanda
Good to hear Govt. commitment to ongoing help for Nepal including rebuilding #QandA
Will Senator Sinodinos support the #Libspill3 when it comes #QandA ?
You can't put a price on humanity. But we're doing our best to.  #QandA
#QandA maybe if Sinodinous &amp; mates took less of the 20 million from public purse Plus a whole lot more it may help the budget
Watch this turn into a budget debate #QandA
5 million to Nepal and then Abbott gives 100 million to a France war monument #qanda
How can you defend cutting 20% off foreign aid? #QandA #ujcomm2657
Nepal is in an earthquake zone, sadly unsurprised by the devastation but we can not be expected to bankroll every rebuild job #qanda
#QandA we can't help because you send us broke Tanya
@tanya_plibersek yes Tanya you gave away money that we didn't have and drove us into debt #QandA
Semantics being discussed whilst people suffer and die in Nepal? #QandA
#QandA "Australia needs an aid budget that matches its wealth" Tom Porteous for this to occur we need a govt that cares.
Australia: Where funding a sceptic and building a monument are more important than human lives #QandA @QandA #ujcomm2657
Instead of just borrowing a 100 million today we could borrow 150 million and give them some .our wealth is zero if its borrowed #qanda
#Qanda 0.18%! That's just disgusting from one of the wealthiest states in the world.
Not only aid- our embassy system is underfunded and has been for a long time, and under both sides #qanda
Tanja lets just say it: this LNP government is totally out of its depth @QandA #qanda
so instead of talking about what nepal needs the two polis are bickering #qanda
Oh fuck off one gives a rat's arse about what either party did. #qanda
@JMojanovski @tanya_plibersek #qanda AS FOR LEADERS http://t.co/xfJHszi5sT
@dannolan oh so you've watched #qanda then
Labor doubled the aid budget. Kudos. #QandA
@thetassiesnipe @TonyJones_qanda Long ago even considered @QandA as a possible viewing choice.
@QandA #qanda look at Tanya making the discussion about how good labour is, seriously can't you talk about the crisis as discussed
What do people bet the Nepali refugees get sent to Nauru or Manus island?? #qanda
#qanda if only we stopped funding the miners and started funding the aid budget!
It makes us seem so greedy when we can't help one of the poorest countries with a terrible disaster we are unlikely to experience. #qanda
Nepalese aren't "white enough" Keep dreaming @adakape #qanda
He said she said everybody we said #qanda
Get the budget into surplus by cutting coal subsides not foreign aid @qanda #qanda
#Nepal needs #solidarity,  we should all do more #qanda
@newscomauHQ @QandA certainly not for a couple of drug pedlars
this is turning into a political debate #QandA
Nepal is Shangri-la. Its beauty is heart wrenchingly lo-tech. The catastrophe is massive. I hope Planet Earth comes to its rescue. #qanda
The average #qanda viewer seems to think we have a massive surplus.... Spend, spend, spend - more, more, more
Di dunia ini tidak ada keadilan. Di akhirat ada keadilan. RT "@bronsgate: #qanda pesan bagi Jokowi: hukuman mati tidak merupakan keadilan"
@QandA @tomporteous Do we protest about the steady stream of executions in the USA?  No! #QandA #Bali9
I bloody love Tanya #qanda
the impact of disasters have is only increased by the vulnerability of the community #qanda
I love John Monash - a giant - but $100m 4 a museum, $5m for Nepal &amp; zero 4 #mentalhealth #qanda
Don't ask Sinodinos any direct questions about money. Or water. Or the cost of travel. #qanda
There are THOUSANDS of Nepalis in Australia. Focus on them, too, and their families! #qanda
If the foreign aid budget was higher, the earthquake would never have happened hey Tanya #qanda #auspol
Shut up stupid libtards #qanda
If Nepal want aid Tony could always give them all knighthoods.  #qanda
Govt can take time to assess the situation, step in when asked - left are crying for aid sent to other side of the globe immediately? #qanda
Sorry #Nepal. The reno at the Lodge is costing $5 million. Can't give you any more. #qanda
Why don't we take down the $100m statue Australia gave to fance and sell it on eBay, maybe then we could do better than 5m for Nepal #qanda
@Senor_Goat your right, just think 400,000 murders should get some attention and compassion too #QandA
#qanda Did Arthur draw the  short straw tonight. He doesn't give a shit he can't hide it.
#qanda Mr Sinodinos has confused public opinion with leadership.
Blaming each party doesn't help. We need to agree and get on with it #qanda
We could use joe hockey as some sort of human snow plow #qanda
We can make up for letting Nepal down in the last budget by helping them recover now from this tragic disaster #QandA #UJCOMM2657
Tanya cuts through with fact - again - yay ! #QandA
@QandA #Nepal If Labor hadn't collapsed economy there would be more aid money
Cutting the aid budget is only cutting down humanity #qanda
Short term aid is pointless. What they need is education so that more people can contribute towards rebuilding their economy #QandA
It's troubling that we can cough up $100M just like that for a war memorial in Europe &amp; just $5M for the devastated popn of Nepal #qanda
The poorest people on the planet will cheer loudest when the Australian budget returns to surplus. #qanda
The money we would send to Indonesia, reroute it to Nepal? Cuz mountain #qanda
Every time Tanya rolls one of her eyes #drink #qanda
@qanda Tim is right, increased funding to the embassy network NOT the defence budget. Soft power beats hard power every time.
Reintroduce the carbon tax so Australia can take responsibility for climate change and restoring our and obligations #qanda #shame
Can't imagine what the rest of the world thinks of Aus re asylum seekers, paltry foreign aid &amp; arrogance. #QandA
Cutting aid is embarrassing to Australians. We appear to be less charitable now #QandA
The pensions are what need to be raised. #qanda
You put it off. Delayed it slightly is a delicate way of saying you put it off. Which you did. #qanda
#qanda But Tanya you cant promise $ that you don't earn. Thats the issue
5 million AUD for Nepal. I think it is not generous enough. #QandA
Yes we should help those that have suffered from natural disasters but, we've got our farmers battling their own natural disaster #qanda
As a Nepalese Australian I am really humbled by the support I have seen from everyone so far #NepalEarthquake #qanda
And yet this government spend 12 billion on 58 dud Joint Strike Frighter. #qanda
The budget needs more revenue - yet @TonyAbbottMHR got rid of the mining tax among so many taxes #qanda
#QandA Cut all aid and rebuild are ailing health system
whenever panel guests quote heaps of numbers i can just see them in the green room just cramming with folders of stuff #qanda
'We delayed it bc gfc' oh Plibz you know how to shut up people #qanda
#QandA between reducing aid and children in detention, we're making Australia look heartless
#qanda Let him who is without sin fire the first bullet.
#QandA I used to think Tania Plibersek was a woman of substance but she is a Shorten inspired whinger and negative loser
Heavy rain is drowning out #qanda now and I can't face turning it up.
Such devastation in #Nepal is symptomatic of underdevelopment. Invest more in foreign aid to help countries prepare #qanda
Maybe SBS sacked #ScottMcIntyre because they didn't have use for a journalist so lacking in basic facts? #qanda
Hey @QandA I'd love to join the #qanda conversation, but I can't because I'm in WA! #GoldenTriangleBlues
It's that John Howard I see on #QandA tonight?!?  #AusPol @QandA
We're going to give 35c out of every $100 under the aid spending, that's disgraceful. We're more generous than that! #QandA
The #qanda panel line up to proffer their most self-aggrandising and inoffensive positions on #ScottMcIntyre regardless of what they believe
#qanda We should be giving much more in foreign aid.
Any confirmation the #Bali9 executions will be delayed for May 12 appeal @DubesAustralia? #qanda
Will Arfur continue to lie even when confronted w/ facts? Guess so. #qanda
#qanda Indonesia may have the death penalty but does not hold kids in internment camps indefinitely. .mirrors anyone @QandA
Why does Tanya sound like she's going to cry every time she talks? #qanda
Took 20 minutes for #QandA to descend into partisan bickering. Not bad going.
thanks for finally tackling the drastic cuts to aid #qanda #AustralianAid
To show that the Left doesn't understand economics, just mention "the aid budget" and see how much money they throw around. #qanda
#QandA We've achieved great things with #AustraliaAid, not just to crisis like #NapalEarthquake but putting kids to school. Let's do more.
@qanda isn't the issue about being sacked for telling the truth? How is this not rewriting history?
Ask Arthur about #icac matters someone... @qanda #qanda
Can cut foreign aid costs by eliminating #Bali from list of recipients. #QandA
@tanya_plibersek you rock  #qanda
We never have any problems finding money to wage wars. @qanda
Rather surprising SBS managed to fire Scott McIntyre when businesses here have been forced to un-fire caught-red-handed thieves. #qanda
Australia's not really interested in freedom of speech #QandA
#qanda aus aid is liberals worst legacy
Why are we giving Indonesia foreign aid? Can't they hate us for free? #qanda
Comments were an offensive exaggeration but don't match the offensive remarks of other sports reporters over the years! #dontsackhim #Qanda
U.S. provides $1 Million to Nepal. Aus gives $5 Million. Not enough? #qanda

Our national wealth is declining with our insular greed. #qanda
Plibersek can't help herself. Exploiting Nepal disaster for political cool points re aid budget... Ugh. #QandA
Arthur Sinodinos, you are a bad man. #QandA
How much did the set for #qanda cost us as taxpayers lol
This waffle re things outside our own violence, conflict &amp; poverty is annoying. Mostly due to recurring reference back to our budget' #qanda
A journalist that clueless should probably only work for News Corp #ScottMcIntyre #qanda
Is this Arthur Sinodinos' job application? Just piss off #qanda
The memory of Arthur Sinodinos appears to have improved dramatically. #qanda
And we go from a trial by corruption, to a trial by media #qanda
Sinodinos is remembering everything quite well tonight. #qanda
Oh please #qanda
We discuss increasing international aid but what about taking in Nepalese refugees? #qanda
Tanya misses the point. The Libs aren't putting the budget in the black. They spend money on climate change denialism instead. #qanda
aid was once driven by poverty. Now it's driven by national interest. Question is, does Nepal fit in that bag? #qanda
#qanda I too am offended by the place the ANZAC debacle has assumed in our national narrative. We were the envy of the world in the 1890s!
@QandA I like that the politicians are arguing politely tonight
@GoldenTalon Nah that would be Humanitarian of this inhmane LNP pathetic Gov Not to mention the washedout Priest now PrimeMoron of Oz #QANDA
Wow! They are arguing about budgets. Are they not still pulling people out of the rubble in Nepal? People need help now. #QandA
McIntyre should be judged by his sports reporting, not his views on the ANZACs. #qanda
The journo's tweet was badly worded and badly timed. #qanda
#qanda Arfur asking Tanya to 'Remember?'  is beyond ironic.
*three....two....one....* #qanda
20' Tanya @tanya_plibersek lays some smackdown on  Arthur Sinodinos #qanda #QandaCommentary
Freedom of speech does not protect you from losing your job! #qanda
Such is the hypocrisy of the right #QandA
Sure, we are the least generous we've ever been, but we've brought back knights and dames! #qanda
#qanda found out today our PM $100 mill on a ANZAC building. How about invest more $ in our recent return soldiers&amp; families? #compassion
#QandA @qanda Sinodinos lied. Kick him off  #auspol
How many people are gonna lose their jobs over their tweets tonight? #qanda
Cutting the aid budget was a fundamental joke! We have a responsibility doesn't Australia consider itself a global leaders?  #QandA #sphpm
@QandA Wall-to-wall Anzac mania makes me feel like I'm in North Korea, not Australia. #qanda
Nepal's GDP per capita is just $2376 whilst Australia's GDP per capita is $46433. We can do more and we must do more #qanda #auspol

Outstanding question. #qanda
Enough with the SBS bloke please #qanda
Yes we are  @QandA #QandA
@MalcomTurnbull caused that @SBS journalist his job. Where did freedom of expression go? Did it die 100 years ago?  #qanda
Freedom of speech is one thing but we should know by now not to poke the bear #qanda
Arthur - don't spoil this important, intelligent discussion by going all 'ALP bashing' on us #QandA
I'm agreeing with Tim Fischer... A lot. Never thought I'd say that @qanda #qanda
Freedom of speech comes with responsibilities. So do all freedoms. #qanda
He was sacked....not killed #qanda
Why is SINodinis there anyway? Isn't he still being looked at by ICAC? #qanda
Sacked by #MalsMinistryOfTruth #QandA
And Tanya (coorectly) calls out Sinodinos on his BS about Labour cutting the #Aid budget #QandA
Not patriotic, jingoistic #qanda
Be careful what you tweet guys #qanda
Our country used to be the land of opportunity. Not anymore. Local manufacturing is doomed. We need a better government. #qanda
The worst thing about having opposing politicians on Q&amp;A is the petty squabbling over which government did better #ujcomm2657 #qanda
$4 million on a faux climate institute but we can only afford $5 million in #AustralianAid for #NepalEarthquake. Where's the logic? #qanda
Zero tolerance for anyone who challenges the Anzac rhetoric with historical fact. Beware the path blind nationalist thought leads to #qanda
#qanda Double standards as always
#qanda *rubs hands*
#qanda SBS reporter can still tweet, Hebdo cartoonists can't
And that's why we have a massive budget blowout @tanya_plibersek you just kept spending! #qanda
#QandA How could the Libs cut Foreign Aid by 11b when it was at 5b under Labor? Put that cash into Education @QandA #makemoneymoneymoney
Spending $100m on a war memorial is obscene as are the cuts to aid #qanda
I love the Tony Jones forward lean #qanda
@QandA @tanya_plibersek @beefabayer
The annoying thing about the journalist being sacked is this - he was right. #qanda
@JulianBurnside Stop it. I want to favourite all your @QandA tweets. Stop being so right. #nodont
SBS advertised for online sports journo today. Do they need to he conversant with social media? #qanda
Ah, Scott McIntyre. I've been waiting for this. #qanda
Tell me Arthur. Did you cut money to the Australian Water Board? No. Not when you were rolling in those kickbacks hey? #qanda
good question! #QandA
Don't let the facts get in the way of a myth. #qanda #Anzac
What he said was inappropriate #qanda
Journalists should be allow to express themselves (outside of the newsroom) as an individual. #qanda
The government diverted millions of dollars from its foreign aid programs to pay for onshore asylum seeker processing. #qanda
Arthur Sinodinos &amp; @tanya_plibersek respond to cuts to foreign aid #QandA http://t.co/Xmamh7bjqw
What ever happened to the tweets-per-minute counter? #qanda
Best to keep the legend of ANZAC rather than reality. We not ready to accept the facts. #qanda
"slowed down the rate of growth" much less than the rest of the OECD! #qanda
@QandA What if McIntyre was right?#qanda
It's like there's only two ways of thinking, Labor and Liberal, so if they agree on something it must be correct #qanda
I love watching #QandA on the TV the government bought me during the GFC
official murder, official violence, a minutes lonely wretched silence #qanda
"We doubled the aid budget, Arthur," says @tanya_plibersek @tomporteous http://t.co/6vM2gYwuXC @qanda #qanda http://t.co/FQsWT2sGVg

#qanda Bit of a difference between being killed and being sacked.
@jofmcmanus hi Jo, you can watch @QandA online. Just google for it. 8-)
Too patriotic? No. We're being too thin-skinned. #QandA
@QandA Authur must have invested in mega memory after icac. Look at him go with those facts and figures
It's not about freedom of speech. #qanda
First we had the "right to be a bigot", then it was #JeSuisCharlie. Where are we today? #qanda
One of my favourite parts of #qanda is peoples hilarious twitter names appearing on the bottom of the TV! Always a good Laugh @QandA
Lefties just want to give money away completely oblivious to the fact it has to come from somewhere and someone. #auspol #qanda
He has been afforded freedom of speech. He's not in jail. #QandA
How is $5million enough of an initial aid amount before "more consideration"? Hope there are bteer long term support plans #qanda
timing is everything. #qanda
What happened to all those crusaders for freedom while Labor was in government? They've gone silent. #qanda
He lost his job - he wasn't killed... Like the men he disrespected were! #qanda
SBS didn't want the controversy, so it was easier to fire him! #qanda
@QandA altruism aside, international disaster assistance must be invited by the affected country &amp; coordinated or insult can add to injury
@QandA #qanda we actually do not have freedom of speech laws in our Constitution
oh jeez can already sense the controversy #qanda #ujcomm2657
History is complex folks #qanda
Still not sure how McIntyre has had his speech restricted. #qanda
He has freedom of speech. He also has accountability for what he says. #qanda
@qanda #qanda he was sacked because he tweeted from an account representing SBS
How the hell do the #QandA guests like @tanya_plibersek know all those figures? It's like prepared bloody speeches! Some spontaneity plz
Being sacked is not the same as loosing your life for saying something  #QandA
It was an inappropriate thing to say, but I don't think he deserved the sack. #qanda
#qanda freedom of speech is paramount to the fabric of our society
#qanda Patriotism can be a very slippery slope...
Freedom of speech doesn't extend to degrading the ANZACS #QandA
The impact of disasters is only increased with the vulnerability of the community #qanda
We are so caught up in the mythology of ANZAC Day that any sentiments contrary to our nationalism are attacked #qanda
#qanda seriously why do we give Indonesia $605m of aid each year.? #whatfor #getitfromthejudges
He was sacked, not killed, for his 'inappropriate' tweets and sentiments. Crucial difference. #qanda @QandA
Dear lord it's not a freedom of speech issue. It's about doing your job and adhering to the policies of your employer. #QandA
If the LNP had kept the Emissions Trading Scheme, not only would environment be better off, foreign aid may not have needed a cut. #QandA
Lawsy and Jonsey have said WAAAAAY worse than that and they didn't get sacked! #qanda
Sorry Tanya but I hate all pollies on #qanda (and off qanda let's be real)
The numbers don't lie on foreign aid. Rudd/Gillard much more charitable than Abbott. #qanda http://t.co/6QxaIrV14k
Imagine if we spent that $100 million on relief for Nepal and ditched the idea for an offshore monument altogether. Imagine. #qanda
#qanda we should focus on how to serve humanity not hip pockets
@QandA 100 mill AU to develop a war memorial at the Western Front. A rethink methinks.
He is a sports journalist, not a political commentator. Personal, not professional. #qanda
Perhaps some of the $100m to French museum could be used to help a poor Nation help its people. #qanda
Labor pissed billions up against a post that Australia didn't have to spend.Don't bleat Plibersek.Labor are economic vandals. #qanda #auspol

He broke his employment contract...well getting sacked is what happens when you break the terms of your employment contract! #QandA
Umm Labor delayed growth in aid, this Govt has cut $11 billion #qanda

The young fella fell foul of SBS's code of conduct didn't he? #qanda
Stop aid to execution-happy Indonesia and give it ALL to Nepal #qanda
Australia needs to be adult enough to question the myth of Anzac #qanda
Free speech is not consequence-free speech. His sacking was well and truly deserved. #qanda
He signed his employer's social media policy. It was a fair cop. #qanda
@QandA @qanda I say Arthur, who's forgetful now???
@mcintinhos issue on #qanda
Is there no "freedom of sentiment" either? #qanda
Please find  Liberal who has more to say than blaming Labor.  #QandA
People are offended by all kinds of things. I'd be worried if we lived in a society where no one was offended. It would be dull. #qanda
#qanda he has freedom of speech, but not exemption from losing his job
Both major parties are guilty of looking the other way when their promises to foreign aid are questioned #qanda
It is unaustralian not to challenge the establishment. #qanda
#QandA how about no bickering amongst mp's tonight? Instead let's focus on uniting as one and try and help earthquake victims?
Tax churches, and use the money for foreign aid. Food/shelter&gt;prayer #qanda
Australian journalists should know better than to challenge Australia's sacred cows like ANZAC. #qanda
@newscomauHQ @QandA cutting overseas aid in the budget doesn't stop us from giving emergency aid when needed
Foreign Aid has been cut by both Polit persuasions Says Arfur WE DOUBLED the aid budget Arthur says Tanya #qanda

Free speech, free press - we are a democratic nation! #qanda @qanda
If Andrew Bolt can keep his job with his views than so can basically anyone else. #qanda
The issue with Scott McIntyre was that he generalised and had errors and no context. #QandA
Let the politicians cast the first stone. #qanda
We shouldn't fight for Scott McIntyre at all, what he said was a disgrace #qanda #ujcomm2657
Our diggers died for the freedom to call them rapists #qanda
He broke a contractual agreement, I have the freedom to say whatever I want to my boss, although it's wise to censor myself #QandA

Clapping sinodinos for government curbing aid during GFC, bet they still gave more than abbott.    #qanda
Really interesting panel on #QandA tonight!
oh here we go freedom of speech question on #qanda
why would you cut off a conversation about a serious policy matter to discuss a sporty blabbermouth? Geesh! #qanda
And yet this government spend 12 billion on 58 dud Joint Strike Fighters. #qanda
Scott McIntyre was sacked for breaching his terms of employment contract not for his "free speech" #qanda
#qanda
@QandA freedom of speech prevents you going to jail for your comments, it doesn't stop you ending your career #qanda
Wrong. The journo was tweeting from his work account and broke his social media code of conduct , plain and simple #qanda
If we privatise SBS, it will be able to make as many dumb-arse generalisations as the commercial stations. #QandA
Freedom of speech is freedom of speech. There's no onus to be accurate #qanda
#qanda blah blah the liblabs are blaming each other again. Time  to get rid of them both
Patriotism can go too far when it becomes a propaganda tool... Let's remember what soldiers actually did, not the glamourised version #qanda
Tony has so many Qs to get through but wouldn't allow a #TPPA Q last week. #qanda
We have freedom of speech, sometimes we need to keep it to ourselves though. #QandA
The Constitution doesn't state you the right to a 'freedom of speech', FYI.. #qanda @QandA
It was extremely inappropriate hes lucky he only got the sack #QandA
@tanya_plibersek for #PrimeMinister #QandA
Nobody is arresting him. The SBS made a call. Deal with it #qanda
Freedom of speech doesn't cover the ultimate disrespect in those comments. #qanda
Freedom of speech means being free to say things that are uncomfortable to hear. #qanda
@qanda why not cut fossil fuel subsidies and raise $4B per year #qanda
Slightly different being killed for your speech and being sacked. Ridiculous analogy #qanda
Onto the @mcintinhos subject. Appalling treatment of one speaking truths. #qanda
If the LNP had kept the Emissions Trading Scheme, not only would environment be better off, foreign aid may not have "needed" a cut. #QandA
#qanda You have to take responsibility for the way you use your free speech
Should have been sacked for stupidity and horrible sense of timing if not for content #qanda
@QandA @tanya_plibersek @BeefaBeyer06
Scott McIntyre is a truth teller. Scott must be reinstated. #QandA
Freedom of speech is not freedom to abuse #QandA
we need to stop glorifying war #qanda @qanda
With "freedom of speech" (actually an American Right), comes a responsibility to be respectful in so-called "critique" #qanda
McIntyre sacked not for libel or slander, not for inciting violence - but for hurt feelings. #Qanda
One sports journo gets sacked for some ill-considered tweets and a poor grasp of history and everyone flips. #qanda
Scott McIntyre was sacked for breach of his employment contract with SBS. This has nothing to do with freedom of speech. #qanda
Yet many go unscathed for sexist, homophobic, racist comments #QandA
let's get started with a discussion about patriotism. who are the patriots? who are not the patriots? now tell me that's not racist. #qanda
So you can rag on Muslims as long as you say 'But satire', but you can't rag on the whole Anzac Day myth bullshit. Yep. Strayan logic #qanda
Oh come on! Can't compare a sacking with the Charlie Hebdo murders. Get a sense of proportion. #qanda
@QandA #qanda the was complete disrespect not free speech. He can't even name source to support his ideas
There's a fine line between freedom of speech and defaming our diggers! #ANZAC @QandA #QandA
I'm in Adelaide this evening so my #qanda tweets are gonna be 30 mins out of sync. I know I can stream it, but I'd rather watch on a big TV.
We were called the 'Australian Imperial Force' #qanda
#QandA  We have to be careful not to turn ANZAC Day into a fundamentalist religion
It was inappropriate for the communication minister to get involved #QandA
Queen had a killer set at Foreign Aid #qanda
Freedom of speech, yes, but there is a time and a place, and a level of respect. #QandA

If I said I was going to kill some-one would anyone stop me? #freedomofspeech #qanda
#qanda no one is saying McIntyre did not have the freedom to tweet what he did, but he must accept the cosequences
#QandA freedom of speech comes  with a big rag of responsibility
These tweets will now follow this journalist all throughout his quote.  #qanda #tweetwisely
To tarnish so many dead soldiers fails the common sense test when it comes to free speech #qanda
And no inaccuracies have been highlighted in satire about Islam? Come on #QandA
Scott McIntyre was broadly 'anti all war' and was historically inaccurate but didn't deserve the sack. #qanda
Jusy tuned in to #qanda Does Arthur always look like a scruffy schoolkid or did I miss a ruck on the panel?
@QandA not just the comments but poor timing.
#qanda Goodness me, who is this woman? ANZAC is all about historical inaccuracy.
Diggers died for our freedom to have mandatory death worship #qanda
Australia's adopting of American-style military hero worship as "patriotism" distresses me greatly. #qanda
Does this lady realise twitter is 140 characters a pop? #qanda
anyone notice Dodgy Arthur talking about Judical Process Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha *choke*****   #qanda
#qanda actually, we agreed to 0.7% of the GNI under the Millennium Development Goals. Both parties let us down there, big time
#QandA at least we know no one would shoot him for it
Scott McIntyre said nothing that wasn't true.  The timing was rotten.  Shame on SBS for sacking a soccer reporter  #qanda
Our Government's foreign aid cuts cost lives #qanda
#QandA @QandA #JeSuisAussie / #JeSuisCharlie. Where's the comparison between a lone wolf terrorist and WW2?
Why is Q and A using the Avengers symbol? #qanda
Free speech is not a right.  Nor does it give you the right to be utterly rude and insensitive.  #QandA
He was free to say it. They were free to sack him #qanda
Paul Barry called him "just a sports journalists". Enough said surely. #QandA
If you tweet for work, toe the company line #QandA
#QandA let's hope the values the ANZACs fought for are upheld @mcintinhos
Anzac day is not "SACRED". Also, people don't have a right to not be offended. #QandA
I believe freedom of speech should also come with responsibility when speaking in a public forum. #qanda
#qanda so did you support Andrew Bolt's freedom of speech as a journalist when he got dragged through the courts? Hypocrites
#ScottMcIntyre was sacked....not killed #qanda
He has freedom of speech, he hasn't been put in jail!  But he tarnished his employers brand and broke their code of conduct. #QandA
How many footballers have tweeted dumb comments? #Qanda
But Turkey was a sovereign nation when it was invaded. And was still one when we left #qanda
Sick of people invoking the timing of his tweets. If we can't talk about it on Anzac Day, when? Content surely more important. #qanda
Something something controversial something something I'm going to get fired. #QandA
the whole "free speech" thing is very confusing #QandA
#JeSuisScottMcIntyre #qanda
Comparison to Charlie hebdo not even close to scott McIntyre being sacked #qanda
Right wing shock jocks called for Gillard to be drowned. Did they get sacked? #qanda
@QandA that it was inappropriate is merely your opinion. #qanda
Ummm, the British Empire *did* invade a foreign country. How else can you describe it? #qanda
Bad timing for those tweets. But was he historically wrong or right? #qanda
Freedom of speech stops the government from throwing you in jail for what you say not from you losing your job. #qanda
@QandA #QandA seriously $100 million statue? Feeding the homeless in Sydney... Not a priority? Nah. Just raise the GST for a statue.
This waffle re things outside our own violence, conflict &amp; poverty is v annoying. Mostly due to recurring reference to 'our budget' #qanda
@dhux411 I'm at home watching #qanda, you group guys....carrying the bank

#qanda freedom of speech..only if it works for our agenda
#qanda Ugly on the outside Ugly on the inside http://t.co/HiKXkXDCCW
This countries patriotism shadows the truths of those tweets #qanda
Doesn't he have a right to be a bigot (or anti-Anzac)? #qanda
We never have any problem finding money to wage wars.   #qanda
He only had 140 characters, guys... #qanda
#QandA he went against the SBS code of conduct, enough said.
Scott McIntyre got what he deserved #QandA
Another case for that old bill of rights conversation? Let's not forget that free speech is not constitutionally protected here. #QandA
You can't necessarily expect a soccer journo to have a nuanced view of history. #qanda
Tony Jones YASSSSSS YASSSS #qanda
#ScottMcIntyre made #anzac comments to provoke ppl. Mission accomplished. Now hes shocked about vitriol from public &amp; social media #qanda
I am SBS #qanda
#qanda yes it is a sacking offence and he is still free to speak just not be employed by SBS
If I was on TV I would be fired on the first day for my tweeting! #qanda
Woah! Holbrook sounding sensible at least up to now. Will she be invited back? #QandA
Greatest ANZAC Blunder? Alan Bond at 1983 America's Cup "We didn't lose at Gallipoli &amp; we won't lose here". #QandA
We might have Freedom of Speech. We also have libel laws. There is a necessary element of responsibility.  #QandA
Tony Jones is a terrible mediator on #QandA. Please get someone new to host the show
Plibbers slaps down $honkodino$ on the foreign aid spend.  Not hard really, Arfur isn't good at remembering where the money goes.  #QandA
Tony Jones, if you let the women finish their sentences every week, you might learn something #qanda
I had hoped to never hear Je Suis Charlie again, unless some hot Frenchman was introducing himself #qanda
SBS - Soccer Broadcaster Sacked #QandA
No reasonable person would think that #ScottMcIntrye's views reflected those of @SBS. Clearly private views, however tasteless. #qanda
Scott McIntyre's views were as extreme as some highly patriotic views expressed on prime time TV. #qanda
We should have just ignored McIntyre as a naive, irrelevant fool  #qanda
I'd rather get fired that killed for free speech. #qanda
Freedom of speech protects people from not going to jail for their opinions. It doesn't protect them from losing their jobs. #qanda
Let's not confuse satire with being disrespectful #QandA
Would Jones interrupt a male so freely. #qanda
No even the IPA is sticking up for this guy, and they tell us we should put up with Bolt #qanda
It is not a freedom of speech matter. It is a sackable offence matter #QandA

What is Arthur Sinodinos doing back on @QandA Does he no think he will get off like Margaret Cunneen #icac #qanda http://t.co/pt51Msyzl5
He raised some interesting points that are worth discussing, but not on ANZAC day. #QandA
Who is prepared to take a cut locally so our foreign aid can be increased?  #qanda
Why hasn't Andrew Bolt been sacked yet? #qanda
#ScottMcIntyre has complete freedom of speech. He just can't express them whilst representing SBS. #qanda #ujcomm2657
Historical inaccuracy warrants sacking? @TonyJones_qanda #qanda
Let's not mention the SBS social media policy #qanda
His freedom of speech was not suppressed. His freedom to express himself was in breach of his employment conditions. #qanda
Sbs aims to provide alternate and balanced opinions #qanda
The tweet wasn't That inappropriate #qanda @QandA
come on he only had 140 characters #qanda
And we're back onto Scott Mcintyre pointing out a sobering &amp; inconvenient truth on a day we celebrate &amp; party #qanda
Freedom of speech? Or factually inaccurate crap? #qanda
There is no real "free speech." #qanda
We need to educate our society about ANZAC. What it means and why we pay our respect on such an important day #qanda
#QandA WW1 was three cousins playing chess with other peoples lives.
#qanda Nasty piece of work http://t.co/THw29RRIAw
Our aid budget is embarrassing. It shouldn't take a natural disaster to get that back on the agenda #qanda
#qanda Why was it inappropriate? They contained elements of truth didn't they?
Freedom of speech concerns oppression of rights from a government, not an idiot acting up causing his sacking by his employer #qanda @QandA
Samantha Armytage makes blatantly racist remarks and gets away with it.   #QandA   https://t.co/n1aqM02pLk
The glaring difference between Charlie Hebdo and Scott McIntyre is that no one killed Scott McIntyre. #qanda
@QandA #Bali9 As Hamish Macdonald's wrote (The Drum) today foreigners cop heaviest penalties for drug offences while some are shown leniency
Inappropriate comments about Anzacs. Great questions though. #QandA
He deserved to be sacked #qanda
#qanda Britain and Australia DID invade a foreign nation. The campaign was a total disaster.
If you're a journo you should mind your tweets.  #qanda
Interested to see if anyone mentions an employer's right not to have idiots working for it #qanda
Commentators have said far worse things and kept their jobs. Remember the chaff bag comment? #qanda
I'm not actually watching right now but I thought I'd say hi #qanda
Where is freedom of speech though? We are all allowed our own opinions no matter how absurd they might be #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Calling all ANZACs rapists is the point at which he deserved to be fired. Out of a cannon. Into the sun. #qanda
#QandA Oz isn't really interested in justice. Justice doesn't imprison kids out of sight &amp; pretend it isn't happening.
'historical innaccuracy' fuck off that's the most historically accurate thing someone said about anzac day that anyone actually heard #qanda
Freedom of speech does not mean employers have to put up with their employees stupid tweets #qanda
It is fair to say that many celebrate ANZAC day merely as a day off and an excuse for a drink #qanda
He broke his employment policy, that is the main point #QandA
They're sackable offences because he contravened the code of conduct #Qanda
@QandA australians are quick to defend freedom of speech when it is against a muslim but not against our own. Hypocritical i think. #qanda
"Which of that part is not true?" Beware all ye who tread here #qanda
"which part of that is untrue?" well, Tony Jones just got sacked. #qanda
Let's not pretend atrocities occur in war. On both sides. #qanda
@drsmithy @QandA crap, it was his own
@newscomauHQ @QandA since when has Australia become the worlds moral compass
@SBS Reinstate @mcintinhos NOW or u will have NO credibility #qanda
We never fire public figures when they tweet islamaphobic or transphobic things. The government isn't sacked and it turns boats back #qanda
Scott McIntyre has all the freedom of speech in the world now. #qanda
#qanda http://t.co/OKgRIsSkVZ
Tony Jones just accidentally let slip his disdain for the common man #qanda
Sinodinos has been healed! His memory has returned. Who says miracles don't happen? #QandA #auspol
a simplistic tweet... nooooooo #qanda
#qanda his tweets were offensive
#qanda five million in aid to Nepal that is only 20 cents from each Australian!
#qanda Everyone is entitled to their *INFORMED* opinion.
Freedom of speech come with responsibilities.  #QandA
#qanda The Gov't is cutting the aid budget - not slowing the rate of growth.  Again challenged by the truth of what they are doing
Malcolm Turnbull didn't like Scott McIntyre. Libs &amp; Murdoch want to control information. Be quiet SBS &amp; ABC $$$$ #qanda
'Freedom of Speech' does not mean 'Freedom from Consequence' #auspol #qanda #anzac100
Sacked for historical inaccuracy about the quagmire of WWI? In 2015? Give us a break #qanda
tony jones woman interruption #qanda
How about we enforce that all tax free money raised by churches is dedicated to events like Nepal? #qanda
So many people disrespectful of ANZAC Day this year. Meaning is being lost by narcissists #QandA
If critical thinking, compassion and, well... history, becoming threatening to patriotism, the problem is patriotism. #qanda
@qanda calling nuke bombs on Japan terroristic is plain wrong - how many more Aussie armed men would have died without those bombs
McIntyre's tweets were entirely correct, sacked for inconvenient truths. #qanda
Oh God no, not a twitter political commentary that lacked subtlety!? #qanda
I *cannot believe* a Tweet failed account for the wider historical context of the war #qanda
It's 140 characters. Hard to be nuanced. #qanda
Surely SBS could have counselled the journalists as the first step #qanda
It was only going too far when McIntyre followed up by attributing the Hiroshima bombing to the Anzacs #qanda
So the bombing of civilians in Japan is not wrong??  @QandA #QandA
Great question! #JeSuisCharlie but disrespect of ANZAC considered sacrilege #QandA
Draw a line thru both of them Tony. Does everything have to be politicized? #QandA
@ImogenDunlevie you never know! It may just scare the next idiot enough to not do it #qanda
The truth is that many around the world have a weakness when it comes to their military...- even dead ones. Misguided.  #qanda
Have your freedom of speech but be ready to face the consequences #QandA
Australians only like Freedom of Speech if it is used to vilify or offend a minority #qanda
He breached the media policy of his employer. He didn't break the law. Free speech is safe. His racist comments aren't free speech #qanda
#qanda Whilst i was appalled by the murders, I didn't agree with the Je Suis Charlie campaign, as I thought that magazine was a disgrace
Freedom of speech means you don't get jailed. Doesn't mean you don't get sacked.  #QandA
Many conservative commentators have said far worse things and kept their jobs. #qanda
ANZAC day celebrates some terrible things. WE were told to send 2000 Aussies to get killed cuz of badly run British war #QandA #AusPol
The writer is defensive. Look at that body language. Not open at all. #qanda
Of course foreign aid is being reduced, our own national economy is in a black hole, you can't give what you don't have @QandA
#qanda Feral http://t.co/g5eMTvap3H
Of course it's simplistic - it's a tweet! #qanda
#qanda If only the sbs reporter stuck to sport - #FreedomOfSpeech
Disrespectful comments about #anzacs isn't a sackable offence. #qanda
McIntyre is an idiot. Lost his job? Shame. #QandA
Come on guys. Accept the fact that we invaded Turkey @QandA
Now we have people getting fired for pointing out that Australia has bogan culture issues. #qanda
#qanda was there anything MacIntyre said that could be prosecuted under 18c?  Hmmmm
In Australia we only want freedom of speech for ideas that we personally happen to agree with. #qanda
Totally disproportionate response. #qanda
@QandA Labor loves talking about how much money they previously splashed around.. Except it was all on credit and in debt. #auspol
let's stop with the 'get [insert journo name here] sacked' thing on twitter. it's an ugly mob with pitchforks mentality. #qanda
I'm not a fan of how we celebrate ANZAC Day, but I can appreciate SBS not wanting someone on staff who insults the viewership. #qanda
We really want them diggers up on that gilded pedestal, don't we.  They were people #qanda
Not like he is going to jail. #Qanda
#QandA it's a 140 character tweet. Thats the nature of the beast. No room for complexities.
Freeom of speech was only intended for political standpoints rather than personal opinions. #QandA
Freedom of speech is only ok if it doesn't criticise Australian icons? #qanda
@QandA Just because people are offended doesn't mean they're right.
Freedom of speech does not exist as a consecrated right, just something we expect. We need to change that. #qanda
There is a MAJOR difference between writing satire at a satirical magazine, and insulting ANZACs ON ANZAC DAY! #LestWeForget #QandA
We've got 140 characters on Twitter, of course it is a simplistic argument #QandA
All tweets are simplistic - that's the point #QandA
Oh FFS @qanda Tony Jones you are a disgrace! How dare you insult those who march and have given Service!!  Jones=scum
#qanda politician should be sacked for being disrespectful and lying.
You may not agree with his sentiment but he had the right to make comment without being sacked #qanda
Bring disrepute on your employer, time to leave, Anzac or not #qanda @qanda
Freedom of speech until it contradicts the dominant majority view - way to cut down any progression in society &amp; culture. #qanda
Twitter give the idiots and stupid a voice #qanda
All we need to do is look at http://t.co/Ccb5X8pBUf #qanda
#qanda poorly read? We have Newscorp

To all Aussie who are concern...Being a Nepalese national I assure there won't be any Nepalese seeking refuge due to #quakeinnepal .. #QandA
What's with the defensive crossed arms? #qanda
Question for Q &amp; A does Australia actually have the freedom of speech right? #qanda
#Qanda "For a start that tweet was inappropriate." Who decides what is appropriate? Why is "appropriate" the new (subjective) test?
I remember discussions regarding the flag and Australia Day on this very show that were not dissimilar in sentiment #QandA

#qanda Corrine Grant is making more sense than usual tonight
#QandA A journalist has no protection from his own stupidity...
He is free he just got sacked #qanda
To be a 'true' Australian, it seems you must glorify war and be uncritical. #qanda
Authur "Mr Sheen" Sinodinos making up facts out of hand. Typical Liberal tactic. #qanda
He should never have been sacked. An overreaction to stupid, ill informed tweets. #qanda
#qanda  really  being sacked for tweeting is to far.. social media does have power but they guy should have got a warning or something..
We know what McIntyre said because he was free to say it. #qanda
It was a tweet not an essay? Of course it was simplistic and very generalised #qanda
"Free speech is okay unless we don't like it" #QandA
How would we react if Scott McIntyre was employed to write opinion rather than sport? #qanda #ujcomm2657
I'm drunk watching this show right now #qanda
The commercialisation and glorification of war flies in the face of the immense loss and sacrifice #qanda
#qanda expression of speech should not incite offence or anger, especially around commemorations around #ANZAC
If one is not free to offend, then there is no freedom of speech. #QandA
Just change the race and religion of the people you're discriminating against and you're all good. #QandA
Big news day May 12 = #Bali9 appeal and #budget2015 #qanda #auspol
And yet Samantha Armytage gets off scot-free for praising whiter skin colour and isn't sacked? #QandA
My grandfather was a POW in WW2. He never marched in an ANZAC parade. I dont think he would have disagreed with what @mcintinhos said #QandA
He would have signed a social media policy stating not to bring SBS disrepute.  He breached that. #QandA
Poorly timed? If @mcintinhos had written the tweet at Christmas, nobody would have noticed. #qanda
He violated SBS code of conduct; end of story #qanda
Freedom of speech means it's not against the law, it doesn't mean you won't get fired? #qanda
Anzac day is about reflection. Not about celebration and enjoyment! #qanda
#QandA he needs to validate his source to justify his claims.
Crossed arms? #qanda
I continue to be a fan of @tanya_plibersek #articulate @QandA #qanda #sphpm
We also need to remember that nobody has a right not to be offended. #qanda
#QandA Issue with #ScottMcIntyre is that for Australians anything against #ANZAC is blasphemy.
Freedom of speech does not equate to no repercussions for what you say #qanda #badtiming
.@DavidBerthold @SBS Operative word there being "reasonable", David. #qanda
Would like to see the journalist on the front line, sacrificing they they did for our prosperous nation!! #qanda @qanda
#qanda Surely any due process discipline should have taken several business days.
If the SBS reporter made the comments in a pub would he have been sacked? #qanda
@QandA #qanda sorry but sometimes we make situations more complex. #ScottMcIntyre boiled ANZAC down to simple issues. Is that so bad?
#qanda But apparently we can insult other soldiers?
#ANZACs shouldn't be disrespected. They conducted our most famous martyrdom operation #qanda
I want this vile, insidious "Us vs. Them" culture in Australia to die a horrible, horrible death. #qanda
#QandA @QandA at least the ANZACs are allowed to be drawn
We wouldn't have freedom if it wasn't for the ANZACS #qanda
"Freedom of Speech" has exposed the sham philosophy of the libertarians as they applaud the sacking #QandA
let's talk about how simplistic the accepted myth of anzac day actually is #qanda
Will Dutton &amp; Abbott not turn around Nepalese boats like they do all others (except dredging ships) #qanda
#qanda You mean where McIntyre referred to "mostly whites" and drunks isn't racial vilification?
God I wish Tim Fischer was still in politics #qanda
140 characters - requires some level of simplicity #QandA
If we applied the same standard as applied to Scott McIntyre then News Ltd would have to shut up shop. #qanda
where does the line between freedom of speech and discrimination/degradation begin and end? #qanda
Freedom of speech does not protect you from criticism #qanda
At least Scott McIntyre's tweets have prompted critical discussion about our military history and its meaning #qanda
Arms crossed very defensive posture. #qanda @QandA
#qanda and now you understand the flip side of the coin
Let's face it -those tweets were a bad look. Freedom of speech doesn't mean you can be protected from your own stupidity.   #qanda
If he was sacked for a racist tweet, no one would defend him #qanda
And there's also people who are attracted to Anzac are people who like history.... I'm not poorly read or a gambler.  Boozing maybe #qanda
@QandA @tomporteous whilst governments of this world keep sending their police/military forces to kill other people, #Bali9 is irrelevant.
To brand all Australians who commemorate Anzac Day are drunken racists is disgusting and inappropriate #qanda
You can insult them. You can say what you want. It's Australia #qanda
Can't these self-loathing haters go self-loath and hate in a little corner somewhere? #qanda
#qanda tweets today and thoughts tomorrow - is anyone safe.
Can she stop calling him 'this bloke'. It feels weird. #QandA
The freedom of speech and due process should be mutually exclusive. #QandA
#qanda  ARTHUR SINODINOS IS A LIAR AND A CHEAT  STUFF YOU ARFA
Tony Jones defending Scott Mcintyre! #qanda #SackThisCuntOnceAndForAll
Media Watch put it best. Just because you have freedom of speech doesn't mean it should stop you from getting fired. #qanda @QandA
#qanda All arse No class http://t.co/1BBlOMpONv
#qanda Freedom of speech should still mean responsible speech @qanda
Uncross your arms. Don't palm off the question as nothing. #qanda
@QandA @tanya_plibersek Will not happen Dont you understand Indonesia and their CJS
There is a difference between free speech and disrespect with tactless timing. #QandA
Let's not pretend atrocities don't occur in war. On both sides. #qanda
Tony, you beauty. #qanda
Sinodinous: is there a reason you're no longer assistant treasurer? That's right ICAC. So why shoukI care what you say about finance. #qanda
#QandA Shush Tony. She's explaining historical context
Only way 2 watch #qanda Q&amp;amp;A Forum: April 27, 2015 http://t.co/JvXSmfxrfs
Let's ask George Brandis that question #qanda
I thinks he was telling the truth  @QandA #QandA
@QandA the public can't handle the truth. As barbed as it may be
#qanda Costello is exactly right. Can't keep cutting public institutions/assets &amp; expect the govt services we want &amp; expect. Bad agenda.
#QandA Anzac Day glorifies volunteers who went fight on foreign soil and then we wonder about alienated Islamic youth who undertake jihad
The ANZACs fought for everything great about Australia, one of which is freedom of speech. #Qanda
Every war is full of offences. Only the losers get blamed. The winners celebrate their offences. @QandA #qanda
@QandA war is a blunt instrument. Publishing has responsibility to back up what you say though.
Twitter=140 characters=always simplistic. Everyone knows this on Twitter. #qanda
No. We have a responsibility to question national myths #qanda
We protect freedom of speech. But that also means business has a right to sack if people go against their code of conduct #QandA
Ignorance crossed with social media and sport journalist leads to disaster   #qanda
Wow... Did I just hear Tony right?.... #qanda
Don't tell me they've shut down his Twitter account! #QandA
Maybe he was drunk.  #QandA
Much of what comes out of Tony Abbott's mouth is inappropriate and offensive, most of which have been said in his job - Sack Him! #qanda
#qanda I'm all for freedom of speech but object to grandstanding! Deserves to be sacked!
at least we don't get killed or go to jail for having our say #qanda
#QandA He got sacked not shot. Big difference
@QandA what is Freedom of Speech?? Is there such a thing around the world, really??
It's called "political correctness" and is the new orthodoxy in Abbott's Australia #QandA
Anzac Day has alway been about mateship in the face of the futility of war, never a celebration. #qanda
@AdrianH83SR @QandA They work in 5-10 yr increments.
Some look too much into the Anzac cult, and not the actual history. He was taking aim at them. Not those with actual respect. #qanda
If you don't like his tweets don't follow him #QandA
Great point from audience re #freedomofspeech @QandA our diggers died not for just appropriate free speech but INappropriate free speech too
#qanda THAT JOURNO CAN SAY WHAT HE LIKES WITHOUT PROSECUTION BUT HE WORKS FOR SBS SO IT'S THEIR RIGHT TO SACK HIM WE PAY HIM
The Constitution doesn't state you have the right to a 'freedom of speech', FYI.. #qanda @QandA
Should have said it privately. There we are. #qanda
#qanda FFS he made generalisations but being sacked for those comments is pathetic.  A rap over the knuckles would have sufficed
Freedom of speech doesn't guarantee your job, stupid. It means u won't go to jail. Insulting the nation and men who died?? smh #qanda
@nattalarico You are right. #QandA
Criticism of the Manning Clarke history that Australia was born of a blood sacrifice should not be ignored #qanda
No doubt ASIO is trawling the meta data now for anti #AnzacDay comments #QandA
I live in Balmain where the pubs place portaloos along residential streets because of all the public urination on Anzac Day. #qanda
#QandA I assume he still has a twitter account, so he has as much freedom of speech as the rest of us. There's no right to a media platform.
You should look for a job at newscorp.  You'd be much happier there and fit right in. @PoliticsFairfax @smh #qanda https://t.co/cOQ7WijSw9
If I embarrassed my employer like the @sbs guy I doubt I'd still have a job. #qanda
I just agreed with everything. #qanda
Excellent question by the way. His sacking was a couple of steps too far #qanda
While the rest of us are limited to 2000 followers by Twitter #QandA
Being critical of the ANZAC legend is fine, but there is always a time and place. #qanda
Free speech sure, crap timing definitely. #QandA
We believe In free speech in this country, as long as you say the right thing. #qanda
Would he still have been sacked if @TurnbullMalcolm didn't weigh into it? #qanda
freedom of speech doesn't stop your employer not agreeing with your insults, probably didn't help that they were incorrect either #qanda
"It's too symplistic" it's 140 characters, come on. #qanda
Your Disgrace Tony Jones you should be sacked #qanda
No-one chased the guy down with a gun. He lost a public role in a public broadcaster. #qanda
I hope Tony Jones is sacked for those disgusting remarks #qanda @qanda
My son died in Gallipoli. Show some respect Scott. #qanda
Twitter is not the place to make contentious comments as a journalist. You cannot elaborate and you sound unprofessional. #qanda
If there's anything we've learned this past weekend regarding freedom of speech it's that too many people have no idea how it works #qanda
Scumbag deserves everything he gets... The men he insulted died defending the very freedoms he is now hiding behind #qanda
SBS might be sacking people to save on redundancies down the track..? #qanda
Im just waiting for the very sad day when people say 'Happy Anzac Day'! #QandA
Watch the interesting body language! #qanda
#ScottMcIntrye has learnt the hard way that sport and politics don't mix you either end up on the bench or sacked #qanda @qanda
#qanda War makes the best of men forget their humanity. So does nationalism.
He did make those tweets in a private capacity. Journalists are actually people. #qanda
Oh boy historical inaccuracy presented to claim a historical inaccuracy. And that IS how the myth created #Anzac #qanda
My taxes pays that journalists wages, enough said #qanda
A tweet can change your life, tweet responsibly #qanda
What happened to the Govts freedom agenda? #qanda
Freedom of speech = His tweet among others still remain. Other identities state their opinions don't represent that of employer #qanda
Remarkably, no mention of a certain News Corp columnist who made a certain slur or two against our oldest inhabitants... #qanda
In one fell swoop, McIntyre tarred all Australian servicemen with the brush of a few bad apples. Little sympathy for him. #qanda
Given the woman who chanted "aussie aussie aussie' at the end of the dawn service I attended, i feel like scott maybe had a point #qanda
Omg! Simplistic is sackable. Lots mainstream media job openings soon. #QandA
It's unacceptable for a journalist to attempt to brainwash the masses. Even worse when it's total rubbish. He had to be ousted. #QandA
Everyone knows government employees must be politically correct at all times #qanda
#qanda Irrelevant if it is inappropriate, who decides appropriateness? freedom is saying what you believe.
Why is Allan Jones still on air? #QandA
His sacking was a due to breach of his work contract. Freedom of speech is another discussion. #qanda
Timing was the main problem. #qanda
ANZAC day is nationalistic nonsense. #QandA
Use freedom of speech to disparage minorities. That's all that is allowed  #qanda
It seems entirely empty when a grossly overpaid panel discuss the pros and cons of financing charity whether foreign or domestic #qanda
Would he have been fired if Malcolm Turnbull didn't step in? #qanda
Well may we say lest we forget, but did we ever learn? #QandA
Since when has making inaccurate statements on the internet been a Sackable offence? Everyone would be in trouble #qanda
We don't insult other significant days #qanda
Social Media is  place where democracy actually exists Stand up 4 Free Speech democracy depends on it #auspol #qanda https://t.co/wyy4mfp4vQ
#qanda Anzac disparaging comments weren't part of myth narrative that has gone from sublime to ridiculous levels, poor timing?
No tears for dead crusty punx #scabgate #qanda
#qanda No problem to find $100M for a new war memorial in France
If you tweet using the name of your workplace, you risk any punishment they see fit. #qanda
Fuck Anzac Day and fuck you. #qanda
Guys im watching #QANDA please be quiet. #screech
Our government doesn't abide by international human rights conventions and we can't fire them. Sounds like democracy in action #qanda
SBS fired Scott for telling the truth. Funny how after Turnbull caused fuss he got canned. #qanda
#qanda thank you Tom
By "far right "anzac supporters, is she referring to Tony Abbott? #qanda
#Anzac Tony Jones are you serious? Asking what part is not true?  #qanda
We continue to trash the histories of those who have died in war by romanticising it or immunising it from critique. #QandA
Good question. Whilst it was a generalisation, there was truth in the journalist's statement. Why was it a sackable offence? #qanda
It's a worry when a country stops journalists from expressing historical truths. #qanda
Some people have less freedom of speech than others... #qanda
We are a nation of hypocrites. SAD. #QandA #AusPol @QandA
He got sacked because he didn't abide by policy which he would have been made fully aware of when he was employed. #qanda
I can't think of a more appropriate time for his comments. #qanda
@JaneCaro @MayneReport I like to think back to his vigorous objection to Native Title &amp; genuine reconciliation. That's the real Tim. #qanda
Restricted Free Speech? He's got his comments on #qanda
I acknowledge and respect the bravery of the ANZACs but they didn't 'protect' australia, there was no direct threat to us #qanda
Yes, fold your arms. Very defensive Labor lady! @QandA
He was sacked because @TurnbullMalcolm had a sook to the SBS managing director #QandA
ANZAC day is not about playing 2 up and drinking lots of alcohol. It's is a time to pause and remember the sacrifices any have made #qanda
He's supposedly a professional journo so he knew exactly what the consequence/s would be #qanda
#QandA yes. Great question. Does he preface his account with 'views are my own'?
Indonesia, you have made your point. Quit fooling around and revoke the death penalty already #qanda
controversial isn't 'wrong', it's simply disagreeing with the masses #QandA #FreedomOfSpeech
@QandA then you better start with Texas as well
A piece of work, is @tanya_plibersek...oops, can't say that.The Handbag Hit Squad will come after me. #qanda #auspol https://t.co/REbdqZMqJs
#QandA would it be anything to do with fact he's a....
thirty thousand fuck i need a job at SBS no fuck there is no way they would employ me because of my personal and honest beliefs #qanda
What exactly makes the tweets inappropriate? What could be more appropriate than tweeting on the day of the event? #qanda
Simple - separate your individual from work Twitter accounts #qanda
Hear Hear RT @JaneCaro: #qanda We should be giving much more in foreign aid.
ANZAC Day should be a time for open and honest discussion about our nation. That's what was fought for #QandA
NO BILL OF RIGHTS IN AUSTRALIA PEOPLE ! #qanda
Journalists should only be allowed to "say what they want" when they know what they're talking about... #qanda @QandA
Timing &amp; sentiment do matter  #qanda
#ScottMcIntyre's sacking further highlights the eradication of press freedoms in Australia. #qanda
Racism, sexism, promoting violence - no worries! Dare to question Australia's glorification of war, fired instantly. #qanda
In Australia we have the freedom to say what we want, and our employers have the freedom to sack us if we breach policy. #QandA
Job loss is harsh but death is appalling #Je Suis Charlie #qanda
That Port Adelaide supporter bear the truths in Scott McIntyre tweets. #qanda
What?? @qanda how is Australia 'invading' Gallipoli a 'historical inaccuracy'? This 'historian' on the #qanda panel is a joke.
I'm all for free speech but... but... ANZAC! #qanda
I hope #QandA covers the "leave your ashes in a vibrator for your partner" news story doing the rounds today.
Political correctness is out of hand. #qanda
#qanda @mcintinhos 's tweet 'simplistic? Yes only 140 characters. He was not entirely wrong, even if a bit harsh. ANZACs no angels
You can say what you want but what you say has consequences #qanda
He has freedom of speech, no one stopped him, no one censored him, get over it #qanda
Comments on ANZAC and WW1 that reinterpret history can be discussed but at a better time. #qanda
@DunningKrugerP @lisafryar @forthleft I wouldn't inflict Australia's chaplains anywhere near children let alone after earthquake #qanda
What is Arthur Sinodinos doing back on @QandA Does he now think he will get off like Margaret Cunneen #icac #qanda http://t.co/3Ypxvd1vwx
Elements of truth cause many to fall. Not a sackable offence. @QandA
Should SBS have editorial control over journalists private Twitter account? I say NO. #QandA
#QandA the whole support for Charlie Hebdo  was hypocritical, just ask Andrew Bolt
Many Australians go to Gallipoli thinking it's the scene of "our greatest victory" (their words). Are they the un-read. #qanda #ujcom2657
Ok, a #qanda panelist just stated that being simplistic makes a sackable offense.
The PM describes Japanese soldiers as skillful and he still has his job folks eh #QandA
Why wasn't a sports journalist tweeting about sport? #qanda
Murdoch's foot soldiers say far worse everyday.  #qanda
The ANZAC 'event' shouldn't be beyond reproach. #qanda
"People should be allowed to say what they want." Of course, it was so simple. #QandA
I drape myself in the Australian flag, therefore nothing I do can be wrong. #QandA
#qanda you can say what ever you want! Given that it applies with the ruling party!
"Inappropriate" or too close to the truth for people to handle? #QandA #ujcomm2657
#qanda There are many bandwagons people latch on to, nothing is exempt
Who is he #qanda
a minutes silence, a minutes sadness, then back to the madness, official murder, official violence, a minutes lonely wretched silence #qanda
#Qanda  #Voltaire http://t.co/GcPYFYM5hJ
No! People in this country have a freedom of speech. But not to be blaitantly offensive  #qanda
But... we have the right to be bigots... right? #qanda
Amazing night: inspiring Kurds, news from Indonesia &amp; now everyone talking calmly and sensibly on #qanda
Take it easy there Tom, don't mess with the #Anzacs #qanda
#QandA @QandA With freedom comes responsibilities
Say what you want but e-professionalism and understanding your job is common sense #QandA
Freedom of speech is freedom of speech. It does not exclude Tweets against ANZACS or pedophiles. #qanda
Let's forgive him - he was a sports journalist! #qanda
I disagree with everything Scott McIntyre said. However he shouldn't have been sacked let people have their own opinion. #qanda
#QandA Nothing to do with Freedom of Speech - Freedom of what to do with your career more like it! #whatagoose @QandA
Someone should whisper to Holbrook that she's doing opposite of what she's been invited on show for ... #QandA
Scott McIntyre has me as a new follower #qanda
Questioning dominant historical militarist imperial narratives is core to civil society #qanda
so we have free speech apart from being able to criticise our nation, lets drop the sharade then #qanda
Are we under the impression he was slagging off the Anzacs on The World Game? #qanda
Yeah - that was convincing mate #qanda
So glad I don't have a job per se. Would probably be sacked daily for tweeting with strong views. #qanda
Turn back the clock with Tony Abbott. $30.00 plus postage http://t.co/qE26X1BEwG #qanda #AustralianLabor #auspol #abc730
Wouldn't it be better to have the debate rather than shoot the messenger? #qanda
Where's senator Brandis when you need him #qanda
I defend your right to say what you like.....as long as I like what you say #qanda
There's was nothing controversial about what he tweeted. Agree with him or not. How can people really get that uproarious over it. #qanda
But Malcolm turnbull found it offensive... Burn him! #qanda
The French made Islam simplistic at the wrong time. So what's the difference? #QandA
#QandA better be careful what we tweet
In a democracy we should be able to say what we want  @QandA #QandA
Freedom of speech means you don't get jailed. It doesn't mean you can't be sacked. #qanda
Will SBS replace the sacked staff member, or did they find a timely budget saving? #qanda
And she didn't address the question in the slightest... #qanda #WinnersWriteHistory
#qanda I've already lost my job so I can say anything
@qanda What happened to the right to be a bigot? #qanda
Freedom of speech isn't freedom from consequences of your fucking stupid speech #qanda #ScottMcIntyre
Unpopular opinion: the point of the tweets was to highlight the futility of war &amp; how the ANZAC msg is often muddled = not that bad #qanda
Any semi intelligent individual would know that anti ANZAC rhetoric would force one to pay the highest price. #qanda
We really are so quick to jump down other people's throats, aren't we?  So damn angry and so damn intolerant #qanda
The guy wasn't jailed, he lost his job for publishing in bad taste.  #qanda
His case is somewhat weakened if he did in fact refuse to remove the tweets. #qanda
Probably going to have to sack myself tonight. #qanda
What workplace policy can force an employee to remove private tweets they make that don't relate to work? Holy fuck #qanda
He got fired, not killed.  Freedom of Speech is about not being thrown in jail.  #qanda
Was it bad enough to be a sacking offence and was that specifically in the SBS code of conduct? #qanda
He's entitled to his opinion, but he's not entitled to be rude. #qanda
Can we go back to Melbourne next week?? zzzz.. #qanda
It has nothing to do with freedom of speech. It is a sackable offence by SBS because of their media policy #qanda
@QandA Freedom of speech keeps you out of gaol it doesn't protect you from being sacked.
We've been encumbered with right-wing political correctness. #qanda
Come on #qanda this journalist insulted every intelligent, educated Australian. He'd be sacked for anti-Semitic remarks. Sack for#AnzacAbuse
On the Monday after the Anzac centenary, #qanda 's major concern is the SBS soccer guy.
Free speech does not mean freedom from consequences #qanda
#qanda Tweeting to express a thought is a bit stupid. Bring back the long thought form. At least 200 characters!
Spot on. She just summarised the whole thing perfectly #qanda
#qanda telling the truth is not a sackable offence
Weird thinking how if the Scott McIntyre event happened in America, he wouldn't have been sacked.. #ujcomm2657 #qanda
If the SBS journalist had have insulted a minority, he would have been fine. #qanda
#qanda Are we allowed to talk about the Armenian Genocide yet - which many ANZACS witnessed and documented? #historywrittenbysurvivors
SBS didn't sack the guy for saying what he wanted. SBS sacked the guy for breaking their employment rules. It's that simple. #QandA
In America you get publically crucified if you dare say something "un-patroitic". Let's not bring that to Australia. #qanda
There must be mass sackings every Tuesday morning after #qanda @QandA
Huh democracy Australia? Your kidding aren't you? #Qanda
We can't possibly insult anyone on twitter? She's clearly not on twitter. #qanda
Also, why did Malcolm Turnbull get involved? It left SBS with little choice but to sack him. #qanda
#qanda he wasn't prevented from speaking, he just failed to think through the consequences of poorly thought thru tweets
The SBS journalist is employed by the people, the people spoke #qanda @QandA
sbs sacked him because they didn't want a backlash.  #qanda
Journalists are human. Humans have opinions. Opinions are like bumholes - everyone has one! #FreedomOfSpeech #qanda @QandA
Oh look someone on the panel with half a clue #qanda
I am glad I have a good lawyer #qanda
#Qanda We all become  a bunch of pussy whingers...
Plibersek is right, Australia has an obligation to emerging economy countries, in particular with the current immigration policy #qanda
None of his tweets were in line with SBS, therefore why sack him? #qanda
I agree with @tanya_plibersek  Its shameful that Australian aid will reach its lowest level in history under a Coalition Government #qanda
I'm confused, did he get sacked because he was not a bigot or because he was a bigot? #qanda
#qanda Why not sack the people who have not educated us all about the truth of all wars Australia has been involved in &amp; the why consequence
So we have a right to be bigots, but not freedom of speech ? #qanda
Anzac day was biggest turn out I've seen in years (been to a few!).  To call them all boozers and gamblers is stupid, not illegal. #qanda
Why does Twitter matter? #QandA
Je suis #ScottMcIntrye ! Would he have been sacked if he had tweeted out about the War on Iraq? Afghanistan? Syria? #QandA
Important to note that this conversation is not about prosecution. Thank you Tim. #QandA
The tweets seemed more directed towards the people out there getting pissed and playing two up - treating it like a party... #qanda @qanda
@QandA free speech only for those who agree with the majority #QandA
Say what you want on a personal Twitter account. On a work Twitter account? Yeah nah. #qanda
McIntyre's only been sacked by an employer, not sanctioned by law or killed. #QandA
#qanda Well we were the invaders of Turkey !! So what are we commemorating  !!
#QandA #ujcomm2657 freedom of speech doesn't have an "appropriate timing." It exists always and is a right to all.
#qanda so you can't offend ANZACS but it's ok to offend religious beliefs? Hypocrisy
A quick apology would have gone a long way to saving his job #qanda
Did this guy not get the memo? WE CANT CRITICISE ANZAC ANYTHING EVER #qanda
I feel the same as the journalist about Anzac. Don't give an eff. I honor the living service members instead. #qanda
Anzac criticism has become too hot to criticise #QandA
@MrNJBaum: An author of an entire book on the Anzacs calling a tweet 'simplistic'. Well, duh. #qanda
Why is Alan Jones still on air? #QandA
This never would have happened on the ABC #freedomofspeech @QandA
#QandA what said was appalling! Its SBS's choice to sack him. Not the law to sack him.
#QandA "I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it." - Voltaire
It shouldn't be debated. That journalist should be allowed to freedom of speech #qanda
#qanda This isn't a free society.  We pay lots - to imprison kids, without accountability.
#Qanda Yes you can... #ScottMcIntyre tweeted as a free citizen. Not as a Eureka Flag waving redneck...
#qanda Agree the question of sacking is based on breaching his workplace code. Nothing more
McIntyre should've known better.... #qanda
As a well educated, non gambling teetotaller who attende the dawn service, je suis offended #qanda
#qanda McIntyre tweeted using the SBS brand. Breach of contract. Sackable. Nothing more.
A camo uniform doesn't exclude you from criticism or question.  #qanda
Twitter is simplistic. It's not the medium for complex history telling #qanda
#qanda http://t.co/0pe79Km1fH
Freedom of speech is entirely different to breaching a code of conduct with your employer. Don't confuse these issues #qanda
Anzac Day not just about boozing Aussies. To see all the young children at dawn service to pay respect makes me proud #qanda
#qanda Get the septic off! Pratt! #qanda
Media companies need to stop forcing employees to use private accounts as business tools. #qanda
I'm an Australian and I do not find this offensive. Difference of opinion. #QandA
I cannot believe Tony Jones just said there was an element of truth to the Anzac tirade of sacked SBS jouro. Disgusted and outraged!! #QandA
I think there's a big difference between criticizing the ANZACs and criticizing the ideology of patriotism #qanda
We live in a democracy because of what the ANZAC's did at war, so his ignorance is appalling #qanda #ujcomm2657
Free Speech! But not THAT sort of Free Speech #qanda
What better way for a man to die @Mcintinhos than for desecrating the ashes of his fathers and the temple of his gods #McAuley #qanda
Tweets were poor decision, but not a sackable offence. Bad taste shouldn't cost you your job. Questioning national myths is healthy #qanda
uncomfortable truths are the very things which should be protected by freedom of speech the most #qanda
Overstepped the mark. Surprised that @SBS did the right thing though #qanda
There's a fine line when it comes to the freedom of speech: how much freedom actually is there? What's appropriate or not? #QandA
I dislike it when people say that a democracy has anything to do with freedom of anything other than a four yearly vote.  #QandA
The arguments about his 30K followers a bit silly because does that mean if he only had 300 followers the comments not so bad? #qanda
He should have tweeted from a non sbs related account. #qanda
And what if these opinions were expressed on Scott's personal Facebook account? #qanda #ujcomm2657
Thank you!!!! Well said.  #QandA
I disagree with everything Scott McIntyre said. However he shouldn't have been sacked. Let people have their own opinion. #qanda
Bigots are only acceptable when the victims are not white #QandA @QandA
Journalists have no right to spout hatred and disrespect who they call "under educated". #qanda
Freedom to tweet #qanda
Do we celebrate ANZAC day or is it a day of respect? Isn't that why it's not a public holiday? Not a celebration as such. #qanda
Before we criticise #auspol foreign aid we must first recall when we last gave a helping hand #qanda
I've just visited #AustralianAid projects in #Timor-Leste. #QandA trust me, we need to increase not decrease our contribution. #SaveAusAid
@QandA #qanda Surely McIntyre was objecting to the overhyping of Anzac rather than being offensive just for the sake of it.
I was nearly fired from my job cuz of innocent fb posts. I told them to jump. I won the argument. #QandA #AusPol @QandA
Don't mention the war... #qanda
Obviously he didn't have "tweets are not endorsements or reflective of my employer" in his twitter bio #qanda
His freedom of speech has not been impinged. He can tweet all he wants, the country just wont pay for it #qanda
It was a tweet ! Get over it it's his right to tweet what he likes #qanda
Maybe people didn't get the nuance of McIntyre's comments #qanda
#qanda  no your  company does not own you 24/7  no !
The SBS journo had freedom to speak &amp; SBS has freedom to sack. All good. #qanda
I find the use of my great grandfathers corpse as a nationalist puppet with Abbott as a ventriloquist more offensive. #qanda
I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend your right to say it.  #qanda
@QandA Freedom is good as long as you don't use your freedom to ruin or take away from someone else's freedom. #qanda
The price of free speech is always high, are you willing to pay it! #QandA
If he breached his employment contract, then yes, sack the prick. #qanda #ScottMcIntyre
You can say what you want. But maybe not in work uniform #qanda
He can criticise who ever he wants, sbs can sack whoever they want - free country #qanda
Follow @senthorun and @Kon__K for brilliant tweets. #qanda
The fact is Anzac soldiers drank to excess and sexually assaulted women. Are we still too infantile to acknowledge it? #qanda
The journo abused his position and spoke out of turn. Isn't that what many of them do? @qanda
"Which part of that is wrong" Tony Jones pompous p....k  #Qanda The bloke was a grub. He deserved to go.  NATIONAL BROADCASTER on OUR $$'s
His mistake was using his profile at sbs to give his comments gravity and sbs did the right thing #qanda
Let thee on the panel who has never said something controversial cast the first stone #qanda
And this disproportionality reveals meanness, cruelty as well as political and diplomatic short-sightedness #qanda https://t.co/XlPbe6jdMN
Poo.... Wee..... Doodle..... Bottom #qanda
"Are we being too patriotic to fight for his freedom of speech?" ...2 empires at war, or sovereign invasion? A sackable mind space? #qanda
#QandA how did that freedom of speech work out for the french?
So the "tweets are my views only and not that of my employer" disclaimer has no meaning any more? #QandA
When will we see #IamScottMcIntyre trending to support free speech? @SigmundMarx responds #QandA http://t.co/C7udWTllx5
SBS have the freedom to sack those who are disrespectful and that is good #QandA
@QandA McIntyre abused the observance of a day of atonement as he had SBS followers and he was an idiot.
hot tip: it's not about breaching any genuine policies #qanda
Some people just don't understand the concept of 'free' speech #qanda
There was a time when there was a great deal of criticism of Anzacs and Anzac Day #theonedayoftheyear by Alan Seymour anyone? #qanda
We owe china 40 billion cant they help Nepal out just a bit #qanda
How many people have seen the workplace contract McIntyre's signed up to? #QandA
Pitching in abt Indonesia's death penalty? I don't hear you all screaming &amp; protesting over the USA &amp; China's death penalties? #QandA
No, you don't get to criticize the ANZACs, you criticize the meaning it has now, and the commanders that sent them to the wrong beach #Qanda
$100million for information centre in  Villers-Bretonneaux France yet only $5million f/A for a massive disaster. Shame Abbott govt. #qanda
I'm getting ahead of the curve. I hired myself tonight before #qanda so I can sack myself when I make a bad tweet.
Well said. #qanda #HumanRightsWatch
Yes!!! Heard on #qanda that it'll be May 12. Hope #MaryJaneVeloso &amp; the others are given the same opportunity. https://t.co/631enALym1
The right to ridicule is sacrosanct. But why stop his employer sacking an employee? #QandA
Aussies don't really have no guarantee of free speech, we unfortunately don't have a constitution that cements free speech like US #qanda
Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel #qanda
The thing I'm not clear on is if this is really a freedom of speech issue? Or is it really about other things? #qanda
Monday nights on #qanda - where four fifths of the panel and nine tenths of the Twitstream find ways to spend other people's money
#ScottMcIntrye's dismissal was political. He should have been warned at most. #qanda
#QandA God help us if there's not a difference between something being in poor taste and its being a sackable offence.
Thank you @tanya_plibersek for highlighting the importance of investing in #AustralianAid  No more cuts  #qanda
#qanda want historical accuracy on ANZAC read: Whats wrong with Anzac:: the Militarisation of Australian History #sbs #ScottMcIntrye #auspol
Contrarian views are essential to a democratic system #qanda
Did Jones get sacked for suggesting the drowning of a former PM? #qanda
This reeks of Jebediah Springfield #QandA
So what if someone went on a rant on Twitter. If we cried over every tweet we would be here all day #qanda
Freedom of speech doesn't mean he should be free from consequences. #QandA
It's called "Twitter" for a reason  #qanda
He was a sports journo - not a historical commentator #qanda
@IamWriteMe: Excellent question re sacking of SBS journalist- shameful censorship in the wake of ANZAC excess. @QandA
Most people didn't even know about those tweets.  Sacking him has broadcast his views even wider. #qanda
#qanda Scott McIntyre did nothing other than express an opinion. We can't hold ANZACs to these idealistic standards. They were soldiers.
#QandA Jones you are a socialist cock cheese nibbling cuntrag. I quote Van Cunthead
If anyone can be sacked over what we may tweet, aren't we on the road to losing our basic rights as individuals? #QandA
Did he intend to be offensive? #qanda
At Least Anzac Day will be forever fresh in his memory as Woolworths wanted. @QandA
#QandA he's a total idiot
Tweet what you like, when you like in a free society or risk becoming a controlled community without freedom #qanda  #auspol
Wake up Australia. The Over the Top Anzac centenary made it a parody of a day of remembrance. The hype was a fucking joke #qanda
Whether McIntyre was historically correct or not, his tweets showed he was not suitable for that particular workplace  #qanda
Should we equally be concerned by companies franchising and making money out of Anzac remembrance ? @qanda #qanda
He did say what he wanted and he still can he just lost his job #QandA
You should be free to say whatever you want, you should also be free to accept the consequences of those words #qanda
Tony Abbott, Alan Jones etc have said FAR WORSE than the Scott McIntrye. #QandA
Oh it's only sackable if I have a lot of followers. #whew #QandA
Poor judgement? Then the PM should be sacked. #qanda
An author of an entire book on the Anzacs calling a tweet 'simplistic'. Well, duh. #qanda
#QandA @QandA Privately he had #freedomofspeech. A company has a right to prevent its employees from breaking their policies.
@QandA #qanda you choose to work for a company you either live with their policies or leave.
I wonder if any of Scott's family fought in the war? Ludicrous comments from a man who knows nothing about history #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Say what you like but if you do it in the context of your employment you have to toe the line #qanda
And Alan Jones? To JuliaGillard?  #QandA
Sinodinos: expert in good judgement #QandA
#qanda Where were you defending free speech Tony Jones when Andrew Bolt was prosecuted, or Michael Smith?
It wasn't inappropriate timing, you have national conversations when they are relevant to the nation. #auspol #qanda
He got his 15 minutes of fame the hard way! #qanda
#qanda @QandA all companies have social media policies, breach of which can lead to dismissal, y different rules for journos? @SkyNewsAust
#qanda Freedom of speech should be practised on one's own account, not on one's employer's.
We actually don't have 'freedom of speech' in Australia #QandA
He wasn't doing it with the SBS logo! #qanda
#qanda  https://t.co/RWEdxGjpKE
Alan Jones isn't a journalist either #qanda
I don't think he did it to be offensive. #qanda
I love how the left defend free speech when it's theirs &amp; not others.. #qanda @QandA
Opinion isn't offensive. As per the question posed. #qanda
I love love love this vibe that you won't be explicitly told to shut up, but you will be pressured and stepped on until you do #qanda
SBS needs the Government's funding, when Malcolm Turnbull stepped in, he had no chance! #qanda
The ANZACS fought to give us freedom of many things, including freedom of speech #QandA
No matter how poorly timed, ugly or wrong, he should not have been sacked. @SBS don't own him and @TurnbullMalcolm should be ashamed #qanda
#qanda How come no one is talking about the Je Susi Charlie side of this question?
..and Aussies didn't bomb Hiroshima. He should be derided for stupidity #qanda
#qanda Being tired &amp; emotional is perhaps the crime of Mr McIntyre????
@qanda #qanda #AnzacTweets So a difference of opinion is a reason to be sacked ... Not every Australian supports the idea of war
Unlike the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, Scott McIntyre is still alive, and still free to tweet #qanda @QandA
On The Fly QandA My zombie apocalypse plan. http://t.co/1U72EyUBVD
Always have a personal twiiter account your boss doesn't follow. Use it for politics, leave your work one for work. #qanda
Supporting the sacking of journalists for speaking their mind is the beginning of a slippery slope into media censorship #qanda
Incredibly poor judgement, says the guy who couldn't remember a thing in front of ICAC #qanda
Got sacked for breach of code of conduct NOT freedom of speech #qanda
Just be glad we live in a country where we can debate matters involving freedom of speech. #QandA
#qanda Poor judgement it may be, but not a reason to be sacked.
I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it #qanda #FreedomOfSpeech
John Howard's stunt double is being a bit of a dick tonight #QandA #AusPol @QandA
#QandA The ACT Government issued parking tickets to some of the 120,000 attendees to the dawn service! Sackable?
Freedom of Speech is tested by the level of offence a society is prepared to tolerate #qanda
#QandA @QandA If opinions were sackable offences Alan Jones would be sacked every day of his career
If McIntyre's sacking was due to poor taste, on the same basis, Bolt , Jones, Henderson should've been sacked ages ago #qanda
#qanda He has freedom of speech, he didn't follow workplace rules so he can get the sack
ANZAC day is about paying respects to the many who have died and served our country #qanda
My family had seven diggers fight for Australia in two wars. None of them would want him sacked for expressing an opinion. @QandA
To be fair Arthur Sinodinos is very qualified to comment on Poor judgement.. #qanda
Does saying "views my own" mean NOTHING anymore? #qanda
Where was the outrage for Andrew Bolts freedom of speech  #qanda #auspol
In the 70's protests occurred every ANZAC day against rape in war #qanda
I'm offensive all the time Arthur #qanda
Wait, so McIntyre was asked to remove the tweets and he refused? Does that change things? #qanda
'He's not a journalist' on #ScottMcIntyre #QandA
Sacked by SBS for not providing enough historical context in a 128 character tweet? #QandA
Exactly - he broke his companys policies, which in his contract made for a sackable offence... #QandA #SBS
If we sacked journalists for talking crap then The Daily Telegraph would be a very thin publication #qanda
most of my tweets are the direct opinions of Arthur Sinodinos #qanda
Right so criticise the Anzacs when it was the Anzacs that gave him that freedom to tweet. Anzacs deserve all the respect they receive #qanda
#Qanda ironically, the Anzacs died for #ScottMcIntyre 's freedom of speech to disrespect them.
@newscomauHQ @QandA Like animals in a zoo, Indonesia want to hang onto the trophy catch.
Freedom of speech does not mean your not accountable! #qanda
Hello. Rex Mossop anyone? #qanda
There's a difference between slowing rate of growth in #Australianaid and cuts to existing funding that sees it fall as % of GNI #qanda
#qanda anyone who thinks there are no atrocities on any side of any war is blind. @mcintinhos
#qanda Aus gave more than A $30 million to an active terrorist producing country Pakistan in 2005 disaster. Need do more for Nepal tragedy.
Don't community harmony and freedom of speech go hand in hand? #qanda
Are you kidding me have you never walked past the pub on Anzac Day? How was the quote not accurate @QandA #qanda
There should be no sacred cows #qanda
Apparently Sinodinos can define journalism. But not his role at AWH. #qanda
ANZAC's stopped Germany &amp; Hitler...That's a good thing #qanda
He said what he wanted. There is no state sanctions, he can go and do whatever wants. #qanda
Why does everyone presume #ScottMcIntyre was intending to be offensive, rather than expressing frustration and despair? #qanda
"He's not a journalist". Shady. #qanda
#QandA @QandA  Most people wonder why we have a public holiday named after a biscuit
Not much different, really, to sacking people who criticise a religious icon #QandA
They hate the ANZACS but enjoy our freedom. HYPOCRITE #QandA
@QandA Indonesian justice is more about politics not justice. Perhaps not enough money &amp; benefits has been put on the table?
So a radio broadcast involving outright racism involving indigenous Australians is cool, but tweeting about the ANZACS is a no no? #qanda
#qanda SBS journalist with 30,000 followers - is that more than Shane Warne.
He probably didn't have "Opinions expressed are not my employers" disclaimer. #qanda
I've decided to sack myself for several things I've thought tonight about Sinodinos. #qanda
I don't like Arthur's theme #qanda
Australians pride themselves on being able to take the mickey out of each other, until somebody actually does it #qanda
He didn't intend to be offensive. He intended to raise an alternative view point. #qanda
Show me the content of Scott McIntyre that was actually wrong #qanda
#qanda I don't like what Sinodinos is saying Sack him!
When are we going to discuss the merits of Anzac biscuits? #QandA
#qanda the #ReclaimAustralia ppl offended me more than this journo
#qanda would SBS have sacked Voltaire for sticking up for @mcintinhos?
Freedom of speech comes with responsibilities accept when it comes to Muslims and Islam #qanda
This has nothing to do with Free Speech. He's not being arrested. He's not being drawn &amp; quartered. He broke his employer's code. #qanda
More like Scott No-job-intyre #qanda
Politicians have said more offensive things than McIntyre did. #qanda
Don't question the narrative #qanda
#qanda Scott McIntyre had right to tweet. SBS had right to sack him. Free speech means u won't be gaoled not that there'll b no consequences
He never pretended to be an official spokesperson. #qanda
#qanda McIntyre should thank SBS for liberating him now to exercise his freedom of speech fully.
So free speech Aus-style = ok to call Muslims "terrorists"/Indigenous Australians "apes" but outrageous to question the Anzac myth @qanda
Breaching workplace policy is poor judgement. Silly footy head #QandA #qanda
I disagree with everything Scott McIntyre said, it was dumb. However he shouldn't have been sacked. Let people have their own opinion #qanda
Didn't Uncle Ben say, "With great power comes great responsibility"? #FreedomOfSpeech #QandA #Spiderman #voltaire
Promoting community harmony doesn't mean you can't question something. #qanda
#qanda I was almost sacked for getting on my "high horse". So I made a private Twitter account. #ProblemSolved http://t.co/ziluOnWpjE
Umn did Arthur S just accuse someone of showing poor judgement?  #qanda
Did #ScottMcIntyre state that his views were his own, not those of SBS? #qanda
.@werna_ Why do @QandA even have panellists like Holbrook this on? #uninformed #QandA
you wait until you hear what i have to say about santa on christmas day #qanda
Ironically, Scott Mcintyre has become a 'digger'....digging his own hole @QandA
#qanda Freedom of speech except when the other side doesn't want to hear it.
#qanda His right to tweet - SBS right to sack.
Poor judgement and historical inaccuracy, yes. But the fervour over "he should never have said that" is kind of hypocritical. #qanda
Alas, #ScottMcIntrye probably did breach #SBS policy #qanda  http://t.co/RO35Ouy0ul
@QandA #QandA Sinidinos accusing someone of poor judgement! Pot. Kettle. Black!
Have you heard a shock jock lately? #qanda
Arthur has his facts wrong. Scotts account did not have the SBS logo on it. #qanda #WaterBoarding
well said Tom Porteous; it's important to question, and be critical of our history. Censorship isn't the answer @QandA #UJCOMM2657
There is freedom of speech and then there is being stupid. This was a clear example of that #qanda
The ANZACS fought for his freedom to speak! #qanda @qanda
According to the LNP, it's okay for Andrew Bolt to slur the Aboriginal people, but HOW DARE YOU CRITICISE OUR ARMY. #qanda
We must be free to review our ANZAC myth but accuracy &amp; context are a must #qanda
Did Turnbull phone the boss of 2gb when Jones wanted to throw Gillard in a chaff bag #qanda
#qanda Scott McIntyre was not trying to be offensive. That accusation is ludicrous.
He has a right to tweet what he wants. SBS has a right to sack him for breaking company policy. #QandA @QandA
We absolutely need to bring all aspects of Anzac legend to light but that wasn't the way, #QandA
#qanda  OH ARFA YA CLUELESS TWIT
Since when is it the SBS's remit to promote harmony? #qanda #auspol
@camino247 The truth is always the greatest casualty in the #propagandawars #QandA
@luciebeexxx u should be on the panel #qanda
Completely valid point, he was representing the SBS and brought them into disrepute #qanda
Who is Scott McIntyre? @QandA #qanda
code of conduct is a guillotine on challenging dominant, nationalist white washed history #qanda
oh what. #scottmcintyre isn't a journalist? #qanda
It's amazing how this panel is disregarding @mcintinhos as a journalist and a human. #qanda
You mean like you did on many occasions at AWH Sinodinos ? #qanda
#qanda #ScottMcIntyre wasn't writing a book he was tweeting with max 140 characters. In essence Brit Empire invaded Turkey.
Behead those who insult the troops #qanda
#Qanda ironically the Anzacs died for #ScottMcIntyre to have the freedom to disrespect them.
Criticising the ANZAC myth- which is glorified to a ridiculous level- is not a crime, or wrong at all #qanda
At what point did he say that his tweets were the view of SBS? Looked like his personal account to me. #QandA
It was his spare time, wasn't it? #qanda
Debating a taboo subject is admirable. To do so in a sweeping offensive inaccurate way is not. #qanda
I dont agree with Scott McIntyre's comments. At all. But to punish for expressing an opinion, thats what ANZACs fought against #qanda
People have a right to be bigots, but don't dare criticise ANZAC. #qanda
McIntyre wasn't inaccurate, but his tweets did need a good editor. #qanda
He was a social commentator ...... #qanda
#ScottMcIntyre was right with his facts.. Why are we lynching him? #qanda @QandA
classic shane 25873 #qanda
It doesn't bother me what he said. #qanda
The question is what was the exact role the Minister of Communications played in this. #QandA
Interesting how those who make a living from attacking others were suddenly so self-righteous when Scott McIntyre stuffed up #qanda
Showing poor moral judgment can be a reason for sacking not just the freedom of expression argument #qanda
#qanda Respect first and foremost. Public critique should be of policy, not people, just as argument should attack the issue, not the person
Anzac worship has become a religion in Australia thus deemed above criticism #qanda
#QandA I work at a Uni. If I challenge/put debate on the curriculum should I be sacked?
Harmony isn't created by constantly agreeing with each other. #QandA
Why hasn't Miranda Devine been sacked for offending the hearing impaired and calling David Pocock a tosser?  #qanda
#ANZAC seems a bit over cooked  #qanda
Arthur knows all about poor judgment #qanda
Now SBS's policy forbids tweets that might bring SBS into disrepute. Which he may have done. But on the other hand he didn't #qanda
#qanda The ANZAC legend can be misused by idiots on either end of the political spectrum.
WHY IS #QANDA STILL A THING
#qanda we will decide who has freedom of speech and how they use it M turnbull  #auspol
I don't think it's wise for Arthur Sinodinos to reflect on any matters financial quite frankly. #qanda
We don't need to stand up for his Freedom of Speech - he had that  #qanda
Liberal governments support racists like Bolt, but hate people who criticise their war myths #qanda
He was still free to say what he wanted. But actions have consequences. Freedom of speech does not equal freedom of consequences  #QandA
Thought he was being edgy.  Sadly he was just being nasty.  #QandA
#QandA altruism aside, international disaster assistance must be invited by the affected country &amp; coordinated or insult can add to injury
Unemployment spike has one upside: we can't lose jobs we don't have. Tweet on. #QandA
@jpjanke: At Least Anzac Day will be forever fresh in his memory as Woolworths wanted. #QandA
He has freedom of speech. He also has guidelines to which he agreed. Not a freedom of speech issue #QandA @QandA
There's lots of things I would not say on my school social media account #qanda
@QandaA #QandA - #ANZAC day is becoming like religious cult.. ANZAC Oi Oi Oi!!!! #AUSPOL
Would have loved to see an SBS rep on #qanda tonight. Fight between the PSBs.
@QandA so Murdoch press promote community harmony?????
freedom of speech should be respected.. to an extent. In his role, McIntyre should have known better. Foolish. #qanda #ujcomm2657
Wait we can ask questions on Twitter now? #qanda
Is the issue that his idea of Anzacs won't help sell Anzac biscuits at Woolworths? @QandA #qanda #ujcomm2657
The fact that the stupidity and harm caused by soldiers 100 years ago can't be raised without moral outrage is truly embarrassing #qanda
ANZAC Day is not a sacred cow #qanda
OMG "take advantage of the platform you are on" OHRLY #qanda
#qanda Je suis #ScottMcIntyre
Sinadinos says McIntyre isn't a journalist. Fact checking is just as bad as the subject. #qanda
Clue- Scott McIntyre is not employed by Uncle Rupie, unlike Bolt, Devine et al #qanda
Agree totally with @sigmundmarx analysis of #ScottMcIntyre debacle ... #QandA
Political correctness in reverse it seems #qanda
Your company (Hopefully) isn't controlled by @TurnbullMalcolm .. #qanda
#qanda poor judgement Arthur?; pot kettle black.
100% correct. SBS brings the community together and promotes harmony. #ujcomm2657 #qanda
$100 million for a war memorial $5 million for the homeless people of Nepal. Got our priorities right #qanda
I don't agree with what he said, but I defend the right for him to say it. #QandA
You might trying to create unity but does that mean we have to ignore the truth? #qanda
Say what you like, but say it on a private account, not your company account with the logo all over it #QandA
So Tony Abbott didnt take advantage of his position to abuse Julia Gillard #qanda
Why don't journalists attack Australia day? #qanda
Employers increasingly using codes &amp; policies to control employees' after hours conduct #qanda
Tony Abbott said that he has no guilt about sexually assaulted children so that seems more offensive. Shall we fire him? #qanda
Nothing wrong with #ScottMcIntyre comments, but he's gone against SBS code of conduct #QandA
Thank goodness Twitter wasn't around 20 years ago, some of us would have been unemployable. #qanda
It's naive to think one can say whatever they want whenever they want, words hold power and consequences still exist #QandA
His tweet brought people together... The managing director and Malcolm Turnbull #QandA
Freedom of Speach doesn't exist to the general population only to a small minority.the people that are likely to abuse it #qanda
Two scoops already on #QandA
We've got lots of "We have freedom of speech but......." #qanda
Everytime #auspol tweets  FEDERAL ICAC NOW! #FEDERALICACNOW http://t.co/AZOuMWWyzr  Politicians fear exposure  @QandA http://t.co/BiNkpCmTGs
On #qanda @tomporteous defends ppl's right to free speech but says it comes down to reporter's work agreement with #SBS
@QandA @tomporteous  incarcerating an individual in a small cell for the rest of their lives  more humane or just out of sight out of mind?
Poor judgement is sackable.  Time for a new PM #qanda
Betcha unionists will be criticised on Labour Day #qanda
#qanda There are opinion columnists on the payroll who are frequently more offensive and disrespectful than McIntyre.
Who is #ScottMcIntrye ?  #qanda
#QandA Sinodinos knows what was inside Mcintyre's mind - must be clairvoyant
Holy shit its Whitey! I know her! #qanda
@Streamerdesign @QandA Everyone stuffs up, poor judgement happens. #qanda
Would he have been sacked if it had been Australia day instead? #qanda
It isn't about free speech, it's about not abiding by company rules/expectations. SBS cannot be seen to be represented in this way. #qanda
Scott's firing is a HR issue between him and SBS. Not a freedom of speech issue. He is still free to tweet what he likes #qanda
Agree with him or not, would #ScottMcIntyre have been safer siding with the powerful in bigotry against the powerless? @qanda #qanda
#Banking #Budget #auspol #QandA https://t.co/co47oqzfVX
Just because you say his views are offensive doesn't mean they're actually not true of reasonable. 'Poor judgement' for what? #qanda
No one prevented that dickhead from exercising his freedom of speech. He's responsible for his own destiny #qanda
Freedom of speech is about right to expreas opinion without interference. It is not absolute. It can still be a breach of contract. #qanda
I honestly cannot wait until this country is being run by Generation X/Y's who know what's up. #QandA
As a social media manager my understanding of this is clear: make sure all employees know about your social media policies! #qanda
The Third Reich tried to promote society harmony by removing ALL dissenters #qanda
Where would we honestly be without @tanya_plibersek keeping everyone around her honest with calculated nonchalance? #QandA
Is poor judgment a sackable offence? Sack Tony Abbott #QandA
What about all the highly offensive things NewsCorp journos tweet and even publish? #qanda
@Susylee1 just retweeted what I saw come out from SBS. - stackable offense by SBS raising hope! #qanda #bali9
#qanda interesting hearing Sinodinos talk about poor judgement
Perhaps we should ask someone this question who isn't biased or closely linked to #AnzacDay commemoration? #qanda #ujcomm2657
Scoop! Not a scoop Arthur. We know this, don't we? #qanda
Arthur Sinodinos lecturing on others exercising poor judgement...hmmmm #qanda @qanda
#qanda When a twit tweets twaddle, twubble follows.
#ScottMcIntyre pushed the limits and did show poor judgement, however the punishment does not fit though. #qanda
Love it or leave. Doesn't that just represent this country wonderfully. #qanda
We already knew that Arthur lol #QandA
30,000 followes? pft @tanya_plibersek has 3 times more than that 8) #qanda
#IamScottMcIntyre will never catch on. You need to go So French, So Chic. #JeSuisScottie is much trendier #AusPol #QandA
ScottMcIntire was not an official rep of SBS. Arfur is lying again...#qanda @QandA
#QandA good onya Mal
#qanda So why do shock jocks get to say whatever they want? @qanda
Is poor judgement reason for dismissal? What about a warning? #qanda
Looks like Tony is directing all qts to Sinodinos. #qanda
That's not a scoop, Sinodinos. #qanda
Andrew Bolt isn't a journalist either. Does Arthur think he shouldn't use media platforms to be offensive? #qanda
#qanda Sinodinas I actually believe you for once, you are an expert on poor judgement, so I have to... @LiberalAus #Auspol
The only sports journos allowed to be celebrated for offending people are cast of the #FootyShow #qanda
Hypocrisy of government knows no bounds, uncritical of hate speech from shock jocks.  #qanda
#QandA Sorry Sen Sinodinos - you have no ground to stand on when it comes to "poor judgement" I remember your 'poor judgement' months ago
A public broadcaster committed to enabling multicultural voices should encourage, not condemn, views that challenge the orthodoxy. #QandA
On SBS reporter Scott McIntyre: "The man showed extremely poor judgment ..." Sinodinos @qanda #qanda http://t.co/zTiKlWzDHT
Obeid and Sino @QandA #QandA
100 years is too early to criticise #qanda
Minister for Dobbing and Communications. #Qanda
#qanda We haven't seen anything from #GeorgeBrandis defending #ScottMcIntyre 's right to free speech
Obeid? #Qanda
That was a COMPLETE misrepresentation of the situation by Sinodinos. #QandA
Sinodinis has a scoop that's already been reported. #qanda
If that wanker sports journo from @sbs had made that remark is some countries he'd be beheaded - seriously! @qanda #qanda
#qanda ANZAC sacred cows in the slaughter house of public opinion
Pack of sniveling apologists on the #QandA panel tonight who won't support free speech. Sickening
Old story, right wing free speech is sacred, left wing free speech is punished. #qanda
I wish they sacked all the politicians with poor judgement! #qanda
Here here .... Let's cut SBS budget ... I don't watch it anyway  #qanda
Talking about inappropriate comments  #qanda http://t.co/N3ozb4ETMY
#qanda Free speech means just that. This is an issue about company tweet accounts, surely? I am always mindful of company policy. @QandA
How did ANZAC day become a 'cult'? #qanda
So why hasn't Malcolm called the head office about Tony Abbott's many offensive public utterances? #QandA
@CraigWtweets but he's still entitled to his opinion howerver ugly or inconvenient to the hero worship myth of #AnzacDay #qanda
At Least Anzac Day will be forever fresh in his memory as Woolworths wanted. @QandA
Poor judgement is endemic #qanda
The One Day Of The Year: Was Alex Buzo wrong? #qanda
ooh Arthur's talking to Malcolm #qanda
Freedom of Speech *SHOULD* be for all   #18C religious vilification laws censor critics  Fix it for everyone, not just  some #qanda
'blowing up in the twittersphere.' awesome expression. #qanda
More breaking news from #qanda
It's an employment matter, and not just about freedom of speech #qanda
What if a news corp or Fairfax journalist said what Scott Macintyre said? Would it be different? #qanda
He is entitled to his opinion, poor judgment or not he should not have been sacked! #qanda
We can tweet what we want under freedom of speech but work social media policies can have serious consequences #qanda
Tony Abbott said that he has no guilt about children being abused so that seems more offensive. Shall we fire him? #qanda
Anzac has become a quasi-religion, complete with legend and inaccuracies. #qanda
Sinodinos: You are only threatening community harmony when White People are being offended #qanda
So it was Turnbulls fault. He brought it to the attention... #QandA
@QandA #qanda So the government can't censor free speech but organizations like SBS can sack #ScottMcIntyre for free speech?
ANZAC is practically god in Australia. Untouchable. #QandA
Maybe we should apologize for having Australia Day and ANZAC Day #qanda
#QandA F*** YOU!!! My ancestors who fought in WWI and WWII were not alcoholics. How dare you piss on our country's heritage. @QandA
So Malcolm Turnbull was a dobber here? #qanda
@QandA #QandA Scott McIntyre should not have been sacked, doing so was blatant overkill, whether you agree with McIntyre's sentiment or not
Freedom of speech does not equal a free pass to be a wanker #qanda
#qanda the Senator questioning others judgement holds little water
#QandA Anzac Day has lost its meaning - it glorifies war rather than being a day when look to end it.
Good one you Malcom #qanda
#qanda Is it okay to criticise ANZAC biscuits I bought at a stall? Not crunchy at all! @QandA
im offended by arthur sack him #qanda
I didn't read #ScottMcIntrye's tweets, but I think the panel are stepping over the actual question about freedom of speech #QandA
Breaking news: an Obeid was involved with Sinodinos #QandA
Anzac Day is like a religion to Aussies and anything said in opposition is blasphemy, even if accurate #QandA
The same liberal party that wanted to abolish 18C . . . #QandA
Arthur's right. If anyone knows about taking advantage of a platform they've been given, it's him.  #QandA
Take advantage of the platform you're on to rant and rave? What? Like some tabloid  columnists do perchance? #qanda
Which part of the truth is a journalist not allowed to express? #qanda
We talk about our right to free speech but we need to talk more about our responsibility to freedom of speech #qanda
The range of view within the general public should be reflected in our PUBLICLY-FUNDED broadcaster. Dismal this #QandA panel can't see that
ANZAC-bashing on #qanda ding ding ding!!!
Why aren't our government sacked for stupid insensitive comments? #qanda @qanda
Anyone else disgusted by the Gallipolli crowd with their "ANZAC Fanatics" beanies &amp; hoodies on, like they were waiting for Lleyton? #QandA
#ABC #Qanda  Somehow the apologists make me feel sick  #SBS
A critical analysis of ANZAC day, fine. A nutty rant on Twitter?  #qanda
#QandA  ANZAC the religion of the people
#qanda it's ok to be offensive about Muslims, boat people and women but not #ANZACs the new religion
Sadly anybody can call themselves a journalist. "hey look at me I have a blog!" QandA
@QandA people said they would boycott Singapore if they executed heroin trafficker Nguyen Tuong Van. How many people sill boycott. #QandA
Haven't heard so much about the contributions of C E W Bean toward this much worshipped #anzac legend #qanda
Its a sad day when people cant critisize govt indoctrination and propoganda. #auspol #qanda
Oh Arthur Get orrrf  #qanda
Does his sacking take the unemployment rate to 6.4 and 1%? #qanda
#qanda not great comments by @mcintinhos but we must be allowed to have a debate. ANZAC legend is multi layered.
Why are we talking about the rights deriving from @mcintinhos 's contract. Issue is why the contract was written to suppress FOS #qanda
#QandA where was @Malcolm Turnbull when Bachar Houli was called a terrorist?
Isn't "bringing to the attention" basically policing? #QandA
#qanda Where were you defending free speech Tony Jones when Andrew Bolt was prosecuted, or Michael Smith?
Why is Alan Jones still employed? #qanda
#QandA wasn't Indonesia's announcement on ANZAC day inappropriate?
Each workplace has a different social media policy. No matter the tweets, if he was breaching policy he was breaching policy.  #qanda
#qanda all pollies will tow the line on @mcintinhos tweets. It suits there mythology
Sinodinos should watch #lateline - u will see another public servant ranting &amp; raving - one Tim Wilson - nothing will happen to him #qanda
#qanda Too patriotic to defend McIntyre's free speech? Anzac Day is not sacred or is that the point?
#qanda is it poor judgment to use social media to talk about refugees or the Bali 9?
So @TurnbullMalcolm tweeted @SBS cep so they would know what was happening #lol #QandA
Does Arthur even Twitter? #qanda
This exposition by Guy Rundle is basically where my thoughts on Anzac Day celebrations lay... #qanda #auspol http://t.co/Z4Tv9ld9SK
Scott McIntyre only guilty of breaching legalities of his position. Content not inappropriate #qanda
@qanda We mustn't criticise ANZACS, but our government classes the women of Kurdistan fighting ISIS as a terrorist organisation !
Je Suis Scott McIntyre  #qanda
#qanda Sinodinos with the scoop! Move over TinTin
If turnbull said it then it must be true! #qanda
@QandA McIntyre brought this on himself. Don't make it political.
malcolm turnbull is a dibber dobber and we all know what dibber dobbers wear #qanda
#QandA
Arthur Sinodinos has some gall to accuse someone of "poor judgement". #qanda
I think he showed more 'poor phrasing' than 'poor judgement.' #Qanda
Your Fave Is Problematic: The ANZACS. #qanda
Quite enjoying the high amount of audience participation tonight! #qanda
ANZAC troops went to war against an Empire committing genocide against its Armenian, Assyrian and Pontian citizens. #qanda
Sinodinos is one of the least credible people ever to appear on this circus #qanda
Je Suis Malcolm Turnbull #qanda
The man should not be vilified by a statement he's made #qanda
Samantha Armytage praised light skin on television today. Is Turnbull offended and does he find it inappropriate? #qanda
There's so little nuance in this conversation (as usual). #QandA
Excellent question. #QandA
"In a democracy people should be able to say what they want" @tomporteous #QandA http://t.co/QItGCte1GE
#qanda As if Malcom's comments had no effect! Pull the other leg!
He has the right to say what he did, but SBS had the right to do what they did #qanda #ujcomm2657
Malcom didn't want it in his metadata #qanda @QandA
Journalists: paid for opinions. Journalists: fired for unpopular opinions. #qanda
#QandA altruism aside, international disaster assistance must be invited by the affected country &amp; coordinated or insult can add to injury
Malcolm didn't suggest it. But it was implied. Minions don't always need explicit direction #qanda
Expert on Asian football still doesn't make you a journalist I guess #qanda
Vanuatu, Nepal, Syria etc show why #Australianaid is needed &amp; the good work it does. We're a lucky country that can &amp; should do more. #qanda
Arty Shonkydinis declaring other people have shown 'poor judgement'.  #BWHAHAHAHAHA #OhMySides #QandA #Auspol
If the #ANZACs fought for free speech why is their legacy not being respected? #qanda
Yep that. What the boy in the stripes said. That. #qanda
Read this incredible #ScottMcIntyre piece on football in Palestine. Not a journalist? Fuck off Arthur.  http://t.co/x7EH2QMqEz #qanda
Eh? Human rights watch guy said company had right to sack #ScottMcyntire. He too not doing what expected by #QandA producers ...
Attack the myth you will be banished #QandA
The scary thing about those Mcintyre tweets is that no1 is even bothering to try &amp; fight for freedom of speech. It's no longer a sham #qanda
Code of conduct as according to the Twitterverse #qanda
If McIntyre had behaved like a troll and hidden his identity and expressed himself, it would have been fine then? #qanda
Off Scott isn't a journalist, then why was he sacked? #qanda
@QandA @tanya_plibersek Where is Tanya Plibersek's response?
Apparently it's only controversial free speech if it offends minorities #QandA
If its his personal twitter he can say what he wants just because people follow that account doesn't mean its automatically a job one #qanda
In Australia we must not question the notion that war is bad. Nor mention the reality of the atrocities of war. War is glory. The end #qanda
@QandA Andrew Bolt wasn't sacked for his comments about indigenous people that were printed in national paper for which he ended up in court
Arthur still has a job. #qanda
The worst and only thing he did was breach SBS social Media policy. Want to do that, make a secret profile and let rip! #QandA
So @TurnbullMalcolm dobbed. @qanda #qanda
Good on you Malcom #qanda
#qanda  so SBS set the Twitter account up did they?
Nothing wrong with telling the truth about #ANZAC. No one on the @QandA panel can refute the facts in his tweets. #JeSuisScottMcIntyre
Malcolm Turnbull is a dibber dobber, and we all know they wear nappies. #qanda
Is there freedom of speech if we're all in fear of losing our income? #QandA
None of my tweets are ~ever~ the point of view of my employer, even if some people follow me for reports. It was a personal account. #qanda
Our speech is free (Unless it upsets a Government official...) #QandA #AusPol @QandA
@JohnTheLeftist  @QandA Just guilt at being ineffectual at anything but talking, all they are good at. Just nerds talking and nodding.
#IamScottMcIntyre @qanda
#qanda Amazing Sinodinos can remember facts &amp; figures on Q and A but has no recollection of details as a Director in ICAC. Should be in Jail
The only session I made at @newwritersfest this year included tonight's #qanda panellist Carolyn Holbrook
Why no call for Alan Jones' sacking after his repeated offensive remarks? #QandA
Cos you need to make a phone call to alert someone who is on Twitter that Twitter is "blowing up" #doyoueventwitter #qanda
@QandA I don't gamble, wasn't drunk? And have a masters degree  and was at the shrine . Q and A host I don't think I meet your demographic !
Good question! #qanda
Wahoo got one on #qanda
This is political correctness gone maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad #qanda
Forget journalists being exempt from metadata laws if they can be fired over a public tweet #QandA
@QandA #qanda where is our compassion ????
Sexual assault in war has been epidemic for centuries and must be discussed #qanda
If only MacIntyre was a "columnist" and not merely a sports reporter...  #qanda
guy on qanda asking question was my mentor at uni during O week omg....
You can challenge a dominant national myth without being offensive and inappropriate. #qanda
To the dickhead in the audience - ANZAC is not a myth #qanda @qanda
Did a politician just refer to "the sphere"? Wow. #QandA
I think #ScottMcIntyre showed a bit more than poor judgement... #qanda #ujcomm2657
Sinodinos confirms Malcolm Turnbull did call SBS Managing Director about Scott McIntyre's controversial Anzac tweets #qanda @abcnews
#QandA  Anzacs fought and died for ideals of freedom. #ScottMcIntyre episode is irony defined. Hope I won't be sacked tomorrow.
Asymmetry of political and social expectations. Jones, Bolt, Clarkson et al judged by different standards #qanda
ANZAC day is about more than just Gallipoli. #qanda
Good question dude #QandA
@ImogenDunlevie ok then don't deal in drugs in that country then there's no issue. #qanda their law states clearly u will be killed if u do
As a well educated, non gambling teetotaller who attended the dawn service, je suis offended #qanda
Sacking was made on basis of social media policy - question now is whether we are letting these go too far #qanda
He said what he wanted. #qanda
When will SBS fire Siegfried Sassoon? #QandA
"National myth"? Moron! #qanda
@qanda anzaac as a creation myth is a recent creation itself - thanks to howard
Companie have social media policies. Whether employees mean what they saw Online or not, SBS had every reason to fire Scott McIntyre #QandA
Is the Managing Director of @SBS a bum? #JeSuisScottMcIntyre #QandA  http://t.co/b7mAiEby7I
He exercised his right 2 freedom of speech, &amp; SBS exercised their right to terminate his employment under terms of employment #qanda #auspol
#QandA I should be able to say "The f***in fu**er is fuc*ing fu*ked on TV!!
I thought this government defended people's right to be bigots #qanda
Doesn't matter what you say, someone is always going to be offended #QandA
We need to visit the illegal #LNP &amp; #Labor wars in the last 50 years, our politiciians need to be worried #ICC, no mandate for wars #QandA
Jeez I hope no journalist out there disparages mothers this Mothers Day. #qanda
"Blowing up in the twittersphere like the time I was on a train" #qanda
"He is NOT a journalist He was a football commentator" Go Arthur!  #QANDA Tony is trying to bring harmony &amp; that idiot ranting doesn't help.
So he did interfere. #qanda
Saying all ANZACs were war criminals is as inaccurate as saying all ANZACs were heroes. #qanda
Sinodinos' comment re: aid budget cuts infuriating. @tanya_plibersek right to respond. #QandA
#qanda Scott was silly to tweet those things, but he knows lots about Asian football. What does Malcolm Turnbull know about Asian football?
McIntyre should not have been fired because ppl were offended by his stupidity.Ppl can demonstrate. This will be used by our enemies. #qanda
@QandA @tanya_plibersek Well let her pay for it.
'Poor judgement' because he didn't acquiesce to cultural orthodoxy that equates with complete fantasy? Why bother being a journalist #qanda
Woah, so Turnbull actually did throw his weight around on this? #QandA #ScottMcIntyre
#qanda soldiers aren't entitled to freedom of speech... So use yours wisely
Lest we forget: Nor the years condemn. #QandA
Is this the perfect time to have a national conversation about the workplace bleeding into our personal social-media sphere #qanda
Overt nationalism causes over reactions like this #qanda
Malcolm actually drew the twittersphere's attention to the twits and got into an twitter argument with him #qanda
@QandA #qanda Does Arthur Sinodinus support a Federal ICAC?
Hope twitter don't sack me for what I type lol #qanda
One of the best audience questions I've ever heard. Well done #qanda
Jingoism and militarism is pretty gross  #qanda
I spent ANZAC day boozing with older blocks in jackets, ties &amp; medals who experienced war rather than read about it #qanda
The whole point of Anzac Day was to remember the futility of going to war and the lives lost. Jingoism has no place in remembrance. #qanda
The issue is to what extent should your employment gag you?  In this case he necked himself. #qanda
I'm sure there are plenty of us who would chip in for a plane ticket for him... Somewhere nice - Ypres or Villers-Bretonneux perhaps #qanda
#qanda some politicians should be sacked because of their lies
You can't expect a soccer journo to have a nuanced view of history. #qanda
@qanda protesting on ANZAC Day is like protesting at a funeral - bad timing
How does anyone keep their job at newscorp if being offensive is a problem?  #QandA
Yeah, soldiers in #war (on any side) do no bad things.... best to remember this line... #ScottMcIntyre #QandA
Gone from Turnbull text     SBS    to phoned  and spoke to SBS #qanda
#QandA I take it Arthur regularly questions the poor judgement of  shock jocks who have far greater audience than the sbs guy.
Who needs metadata legislation when you have social media savvy politicians like Turnbull #qanda
This little Eurasian in the audience is adorable #qanda
"Can do whatever he likes in his spare time" = two Twitter accounts. Simple. Make sure to read social media policy or risk the sack. #qanda
It is fashionable and pathetic that degrading the average Australian is so defended by the left- eg on this show. #qanda
It is perhaps a dangerous trend for us to call for people's heads so often when they express offensive opinions #qanda
Arthur's got a "scoop"? Politicians are now journalists, the future's finally here. WOW those metadata laws were effective #qanda
The militarism of war. No way #qanda
Criticising Anzac mythology is OK. Didn't do it very well. Less emotive stuff, more checking of facts needed at this time #qanda
Oh! Turnbull just robbed him in to the boss. #qanda
We need to re-educate, and reassess how we treat and tell our Australian history. Tell the good and the bad, don't hide the truth. #qanda
#qanda While we're at it, why was there no uproar and street marches when Al-Shabaab killed dozens of uni students in Kenya?
I suppose everyone is prone to poor judgement. #qanda
@QandA how does Andrew bolt still have a job?
If the right liked football they could have gotten worked up over McIntyre's great reporting about Palestine at the Asian Cup. #Qanda
He probably should have tweeted under another name. #qanda
@QandA #QandA  "blowing up in the Twitter-sphere" - love your ability to articulate jargon
Do the Lefties who support McIntyre's #freedomofsspeech also support similar freedoms for their adversaries? #qanda
Does Andrew Bolt take advantage of his platform to push his racist, bigoted and offensive views? #qanda
@SukumaranChan @giantswood @ABCmediawatch @cnnbrk @QandA @MercyCampaign @WeStand4Mercy  is this true?
Let's face it. Many people are not saying what they really think in this discussion #QandA
Australia's human rights abuses are mind blowing...lets focus on these rather than human rights abuses of other nations  #qanda
People love talking about freedom of the speech, until someone voices something they disagree with. #qanda @mcintinhos
#qanda http://t.co/lvdq5QbSVo
Scott's tweets were about more than one war. He included a picture of the shadow of people post Hiroshima first. Mentioned Japan.  #qanda
If he made it easier for foreigners to buy Australia that would be ok, just what ANZACs fought and died for. #qanda
I got yelled at for posting a picture of a Japanese War Memorial on ANZAC day this year. Yeah. #qanda
To celebrate Anzac, we cannot sell Brandzac #qanda #ujcomm2657
#qanda But was it good judgement for Malcolm Fun bull to ring SBS MD? @qanda
Fun how Sinodinos of all people is preaching on reasons why people should lose their jobs. #qanda
I disagreed with at least 70% of what media said about #Anzac but I don't think journos should be sacked @qanda #qanda
What this guy is saying. Boom. #QandA
So there you go.  If you'd like Malcolm Turnbull to intervene in a matter, just get it trending on Twitter. #Qanda
#qanda nothing good comes from war.. or tweeting about it it would seem
#QandAnimalFarm #QandA
#QandA maybe @mcintinhos could get a job at Newscorp - they won't sack you no matter how offensive you are
Gotta love watching Mum on #QandA ... but the kids want to know if there are any ads?! @SigmundMarx
ANZAC is no myth to the thousands that died giving us the freedoms we now have!! #QandA
The #ScottMcIntyre issue isn't about freedom of speech, it's about the breech of his company's policy. #qanda
#qanda #centrelink #people #WhatMattersToMe  question what are your  opinions on the new basics card for centrelink people?
#QandA was he suggesting my grandfather died in vain
Don't see Tony Abbott get the sack for misappropriate comments on @QandA
@newscomauHQ @tanya_plibersek @tomporteous @QandA yeah, except that money was all on credit and is now crunching a huge debt.. Nice job.
In the future policy will be determined by fools using twitter #qanda
Sadly as he identified as an SBS reporter on Twitter he was representing SBS. They had a right to fire him for misrepresentation #qanda
A Liberal Minister rings an Obeid.  Sounds familiar.  #QandA
#qanda Sometimes communities need to be torn apart by free speech before they can be put back together.
@QandA @SigmundMarx like Scott McIntyre, you are trivilising tragedy. #qanda
Our PM can insult our original inhabitants by saying nothing much happened before 1788. But criticise ANZACs and look what happens! #qanda
#qanda yet the ABC defended the Chaser's song - 'even dickheads become good blokes when they're dead' Double standard?
#qanda Anzac commemoration was gentle &amp; compassionate not jingoistic
#QandA For all those who think its okay to stomp on the dead, leave Australia, then you can have all the freedom you like
@QandA #qanda Did Turnbull report Bolte had been found guilty of lying about Aboriginal people to Murdoch? #auspol
Why are companies so tripped out about any employee who has an opinion?  So bloody what? #qanda
Supply journalists with business accounts so they aren't forced to use their private accounts as business tools #qanda
The Iraq war was full of propaganda. #qanda
Good answer Tanya #QandA
You can't legislate against stupidity #qanda
Like America, Australia loves myth making and hero worship. In the meantime, there are active duty service members who are homeless.. #qanda
Scott McIntyre had the right to say what he did and SBS had the right to fire him #qanda @qanda
I don't wholly disagree with Mcintyre's views, but if he breached his employer's policies, his employment shouldn't be guaranteed #qanda
Freedom of speech can only be infringed by a government; not individuals, companies, or organisations #QandA
Freedom of speech stops when you sign a dotted line. #qanda
Scott McIntyre = Jingo Starr #qanda
#qanda Freedom of speech protects him from being jailed, not from being fired
#qanda I followed @mcintinhos 2day because of truth told. All the celebrations R inappropriate. The diggers would b disappointed of expense.
Disrepute is a subjective term defined by the dominant power group. #qanda
Can #qanda stop letting audience members enter the debate. Ask your questions, let the panel do the real talking. #WasteOfTime
Anzac Day is broadly anti war and that was the core of Scott McIntyre's somewhat idiotic tweets. #qanda
Everyone has the right to an opinion, but every company has their own set of guidelines #ujcomm2657 #qanda
We need to scrutinise and criticise our county's past or fall into the trap of blind acceptance, especially in relation to war. #QandA
#Qanda http://t.co/esYeO7aJgI
But there was no censorship? He said what he wanted to say, SBS sacked him - no rights infringed? #QandA
What should I have for a snack #qanda
Yes! ANZAC is being used to create jingoism that is dangerous and scary #qanda
#qanda https://t.co/XjtcJY3rFP
People have a right to be bigots- the honourable @TonyAbbottMHR #Straylia! #QandA
@maelduin_ross @MsRonnyB @QandA Yeah, a 'deadly FUp'.
It's the way he expressed his freedom of speech that was the problem #QandA
#QandA #MacIntyre was not tweeting in his capacity as a SBS sports reporter. Surely he can express his own views, however offensive
not all anzacs tho scotty #qanda
The sentimental nostalgia about ANZAC infantilises us.  #qanda
#qanda The justification of sacking Mcintyre is a hideous attack on freedom of speech.
ANZAC highlights the horrors of war. Why disrespect that? #QandA
Honestly this shouldn't be about the freedom of speech (because he has that freedom) it's about workplace rights #QandA
#qanda so now we understand why Muslims get upset when we criticise what's sacred to them
Journalists today get away with a lot criticising minorities and thats called freedom of speech too #qanda
"Drinking gambling white bogans". Sounds like racism to me! #qanda
Definitely skipping the  pathetic #qanda now for the slugfest between Timmy the human rights abuser and Greg Barnes supporter of free speech
#QandA What about the newscorp hacks who are disparaging minorities everyday? Oh company policy -My bad.
I don't think a journalist losing his job due to outlandish tweets is comparable to the Charlie Hedbo attacks. What a silly question. #qanda
Politicians calculate that aid is not a vote-changer. RT @BevanShields: The facts on the foreign aid budget #qanda http://t.co/u7Ah2VTRUm
All sides in conflict (usually) have atrocities to answer for but timing, sensitivity and accuracy are key #QandA @QandA #ujcomm2657
#qanda telling the truth these days is a revolution
Doesn't Turnbull have better shit to do than publicly shame journalists? Doesn't he have an NBN to go ruin? #QandA
i find it ironic that half the people missing the point and screaming freedom of speech use a fake name on facebook #qanda
KAK 4 #QANDA (ping @Rob_Stott).
The Communications Minister contacting the SBS director under his portfolio is exercising influence #QandA
#QandA ain'ts tweets just electronic graffiti?
Remember to separate work and Twitter #qanda
Holy #vache it's only Monday??? I was wondering why I was seeing #QandA tweets.  Starting to understand the fabled @tourdecure_aus #bubble.
A breach of a code of conduct does not equate to being authorized to sack him @QandA
With any luck, this kerfuffle may be the beginning of a step back from hypersensitivity to people's private online activities. #QandA
It's not about freedom of speech- of course he can say what he wants. But that shouldn't protect him from being sacked.  #qanda
It's Anzac Day: How dare you not glorify war?! Our brave boys committing non-domestic violence should be celebrated #qanda It's all we have!
The pride of the #IslamicState  industry #ISIS  #daesh  #USA #qanda  #Europe #IslamicStateMedia http://t.co/mO8dIf8xkR
@shane25873 Well done! :)    #QandA
And Cory Bernadj has never said anything offensive #qanda
Put it this way: McIntyre was sacked because of the public outrage. Without that, the "social media policy" doesn't get enforced #qanda
I still just can't trust anyone who worked under John Howard #qanda
As an employer, would *you* tolerate such behaviour on a social media account tied into your organisation? #qanda
Arthur Sinodinos knows a thing or two about poor judgement #qanda
1. The Scott McIntyre issue has nothing to do with freedom of speech. It's about business codes of standards. #qanda
I just sigh when I hear young people whine about our involvement in wars especially as they are in English rather than Japanese #qanda
Australia the clever country: $110M cut to CSIRO $100M for Memorial for the dead #StopModernity #qanda #auspol
#ScottMcIntyre losing job 4 his tweet is akin 2 blasphemy laws ushered in by stealth #qanda #auspol No ANZAC would agree with firing him
We have the right to bag the freedom of speech of others #QandA
#qanda We mustn't criticise ANZACS, but our government classes the women of Kurdistan fighting ISIS as a terrorist organisation !
Instead of watching #qanda I'm watching Jackass Number Two. I think I'm doing the right thing
Let's see all the politicians who say/do something offensive get sacked. #auspol #QandA
Sinodinos objects to someone using their media platform to influence people. Um...have you not heard of Murdoch or NewsCorp? #QandA
This #ANZACDay we have gone from commemoration to open celebration of those dead is war - a dangerous thing #qanda
Arthur sinondinos using the word "twittersphere" is like my greek grandmother using the word "dubstep." #qanda
nice question @tomrjoyner. weird seeing people I know on #qanda
#QandA And I will defend your right to say them.
. #qanda
#qanda poorly read may not be appropriate on this one but could explain the election of a Tory Govt!
Freedom of speech isn't guaranteed anywhere #knowyourrights #QandA
@QandA #QandA No disrepute clauses are common in contracts. They were right to sack him
Listen to the voices of diggers: "War is organised murder and nothing else." #qanda #ANZAC http://t.co/1q6yyAdd9v
We've been told who to go to war with for the last 120 years. MAybe it's time we stop spending money on killing #QandA #AusPol @QandA
@QandA #qanda We insult all our #Indigenous population every #AustraliaDay and #AnzacDay No mention of that
#qanda We spit on the ANZAC's grave by trying to glorify the dead. We must question the reality.
Freedom of speech is only afforded to our government. #qanda
Would it have made a difference if he used a second private account? #qanda
If he had questioned the existence of Santa at Christmas would he had been sacked? #qanda
Surely we can separate the views of a person on their personal social media from the company they are employed by #qanda
So because he was employed he can't say what he feels. I guess if he was unemployed he'd be fine and no one would give a shit. #qanda
Hear hear, Tanya. Iraq was one of our greatest follies. #qanda
We definitely should be able to criticism Australia involvement in war #qanda invasion in Iraq justified?
anyone who tweets in the #qanda thread also into pressing flowers? am i the only one!? i'm so lonely..
#QandA overstepped the mark is an understatement
@mansillo let us dictate what the ANZACs died for #qanda
@QandA then what is freedom of speech?
The national myth is such a delicate, fragile flower - can it really not stand up to a simple wind or even a breeze? #qanda
There is no argument. You use your employers logo, you side by their policies. #qanda
@Qanda #qanda we do not have freedom of speech if what we say is ruled by company policies and the threat of the sack
Don't see Tony Abbott get the sack for misappropriate comments @QandA
Yeah, freedom of speech is got its limits either. #QandA
Mcintyre was on a rant. He can't be seen as an unbiased Journo. War sucks but pls don't disrespect the veterans and their memory. #qanda
Turnbull phoned the SBS boss over tweets to show the government uses fear off funding cuts to exercise policy #qanda
That's just what I need. An Asian Australian telling my that the Anzac story is a myth #qanda
#qanda Don't tweet drunk
Sinodonos was chief of staff when all Iraq happened yes? Talking about lies used to sell war #qanda
Freedom of speech should have no rules #qanda
Aussies don't really have a guarantee of free speech, we unfortunately don't have a constitution that cements free speech like US #qanda
The Anzacs fought Nazis &amp; imperialists who wanted to shut down free speech #qanda
We might put that in the human rights basket #QandA
Ridiculous that SBS employees be sacked for criticising ANZACS, who were soldiers, not saints #QandA
If people think Aussies have never committed war crimes they're dreaming! #qanda
#qanda "Freedom" of speech is fluid. It depends on what is said and about whom.
#qanda Scot McIntyre is free to speak, Andrew Bolt is not
Well I won't be going to work tomorrow for having a go at the panel of @RazorWilson your fired !!? @QandA #QandA
What community do we imagine for Australia? My hope is for a connected community built around trust &amp; humanity #QandA @deebrooks101 #ABCD
#qanda The truth is rarely 'appropriate'
Anzac is not a myth FFS! #QandA
Have your freedom of speech but only face a consequence if you go against the white patriarchy #QandA
To deconstruct a myth is not sackable offence #qanda
#QandA  It was OK back in the 70 s to deride the Vietnam Vets and many still suffer PTSD
My wife says I should tweet to make this program more interesting. #qanda
#qanda Can ummm @tanya_plibersek ummmmm stop ummm saying ummmm in between ummmm every ummmm second ummmm word?   So ummm annoying
Free speech doesn't mean consequence free speech. #Qanda
#qanda I support Scott McIntyres right to say what he said however distasteful, however it was done on an SBS account. That why he is fired
Too many post-dawn beers by McIntyre #qanda #1stworldproblems
@Any1ButTony @MayneReport @QandA Hear freaking hear!
#qanda Who has been involved in more wars than ANY OTHER NATION and never been (ground) invaded...that would be Australia !!!!
He still has his freedom of speech. Just no more job #qanda #ScottMcIntyre
Do we actually have freedom of speech in Australia anyway? Like actual rights and shit? #qanda
It's incredible that those who fought for Bolt's right to publish factually incorrect views in print support McIntyre's sacking #qanda
Were his tweets inaccurate though, are you denying that what he's saying happened? #Qanda
Some journalists are paid handsomely to be offensive and wrong. Alan Jones, Andrew Bolt... #qanda
Arthur complaining that Scott's tweets were offensive and dangerous to social cohesion, how about saying muslims are terrorists. #qanda
Yes, Scott McIntyre showed poor judgement, but did he really deserve to be fired due to his ANZAC day tweets? #ujcomm2657 #qanda
This is a workplace matter. Not a freedom of speech debate. #qanda
But if regular people criticise ANZAC day it's just not as effective #QandA
So many real diggers would be turning in their graves over what Anzac Day has become #QandA
@jboyd92 not all Australians are racist. he didn't say 'all' either. #qanda
Free speech is not free #qanda
Tanya just so inspiring #qanda
Australia has a horrific double standard. We let raging sexists, racists and homophobes off the hook #QandA
We have no bill of rights protecting this man #qanda
Sadly, he would still have a job if he acted like an anonymous troll. At least he made himself known. #QandA
"I certainly don't think (McIntyre's) comments were appropriate." @tanya_plibersek #qanda @qanda http://t.co/MyzqoxyJBt
#qanda - The ABC's Scott Macintyre Interpretive Centre
Seem only appropriate surely that a SBS employee would seek to highlight the Turkish or Japanese perspective to Anzac aggression. #qanda
Scott Mcintire had the right to free speech,but he was talking on behalf of SBS. They did not like what he was saying on their behalf #qanda
#QandA please address the veracity of the tweets- are they true or not?
the entire commercialization of ANZAC is offensive #qanda
Would it be okay for a firm's social media policy to say "you shall say nothing negative about the Liberal party" #qanda
The McIntyre case has taught me that I don't have an opinion on anything #qanda
I feel like the real issue here is SBS workplace policy? #qanda
@QandA #qanda As #ScottMcIntyre doesn't deal directly with current affairs he is allowed to comment on #AnzacDay as a human being.
So Alan jones can say what he likes without censure? @QandA
Scott McIntyre could not have thought there'd be no repercussions from those tweets. #QandA #ujcomm2657
I was taught war poetry in school, that said far worse things about World War One than he... #QandA
I just cannot get over the blind hypocrisy from the likes of Chris Kenny re Scott McIntyre #qanda
I could barely keep up with QandA. So many important things to discuss this week.
Why was Piers Akerman sacked from ABC's "Insiders"? #qanda
I guess the phrase "views expressed here are my own and not that of my employer" doesn't actually cover you #qanda @QandA
I would say most people are poorly read on all Australian history, especially the first Australians! #qanda
Nobody would have a grasp on poor judgement like Arfur $inodino$ #hypocrisy #peopleinglasshouses  @QandA #qanda
Freedom of speech is measured by the amount of offensive speech that is tolerated. #qanda
Eh? Human rights watch guy said company had right to sack #ScottMcintyre. He too not doing what expected by #QandA producers ...
#Qanda #ScottMcIntyre's sacking is about misrepresenting his employer SBS - not about free speech.
Freedom of speech doesn't give the right to slander a significant part of what makes this nation what is.  #qanda
God, we're so bloody conservative, so quick to take offence.  BORING #qanda
I believe freedom of speech is a basic human right. I also believe that free speech can be abused e.g. Westboro Church in the U.S. #qanda
How does the #McIntyre situation compared with the Kate Hopkins 'migrant' article situation? #QandA @QandA
Some people need to read the fine print re. social media workplace policy. #QandA
If you want freedom of speech McIntyre get your own Twitter account and earn your followers with those comments #qanda #QandA
Dropping atomic bombs on Japanese civilians is classic terrorism #QandA
#qanda we all make errors of judgement. Was there a warning ???!
A thing to remember is that there was rape in WWI, sometimes committed by Anzacs. There is in every war #qanda
no, but we'll knock on the door in the middle of the day #qanda
Chilling speech: metadata retention, ASIO act change. We're all at risk now. #qanda
Australia had nothing to do with dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. His tweet in that regard was plain wrong. #qanda
If #ScottMcIntyre had raved on his own or work social media account he shouldve known its gonna be out there #qanda #silenceisgolden
Maybe the first thing targeted with the SBS cuts was their Code of Conduct? #QandA
#QandA Had his comments had some aspect of positivity / education / constructive criticism maybe it could of been acceptable #careerdriven
Freedom of speech also now doesn't extend to reporting on "antiterror" operations, whatever they are. #qanda
#qanda workplaces need to educate their workers and have a policy in place
Are you loving the attention now Scott? #qanda
We would have hardly any politicians left if they all got sacked for offensive stuff they have said about the public #qanda
I think his comments may just be describing the reality of war therefore he should probably get that aussie #fairgo #qanda #auspol
2. Unsurprisingly, leftists only care about protecting 'freedom of expression' when it affects ideas they agree with. #qanda
Netflix is evil. I haven't watched #qanda in three weeks. Or maybe it's good thing ...
Is there a list which identifies exactly who is and isn't a journalist? #qanda
That Port Adel supporter bear the truths in McIntyre tweets in being poorly-read, largely white, nationalist drinkers and gamblers #qanda
The workplace would have policies in place to prevent this. This has nothing to do with freedom of speech @QandA #QandA
Turnbull made sure that a lot more than 30,000 Twitter followers heard his views  #qanda
As Communications minister @TurnbullMalcolm is effectively the "boss" of SBS: deserves nor warrants criticism on this issue. #qanda #auspol
If he'd appeared on the #footshow wearing a bathrobe and a tea-towel talking in a silly accent about camels he'd be fine #qanda
McIntyre was crude and broke SBS policy, he deserved punishment, but SBS policy also saves dismissal for the most serious offences. #qanda
Turnbull's a dobber. Turnbull's a dobber. #qanda
Everyone arguing McIntyre brought SBS into disrepute, how? Everyone is using his name, clearly his words and not those of SBS. #qanda
Could there be any more proof that the Anzac myth is jingoistic and misogynistic than this muzzling? #qanda
It's interesting that many commentators re: #ScottMcIntyre don't think there is much dissent in Aust about our Anzac worship. #qanda
He wouldn't be facing the sack if his comments had been measured and respectful of those servicemen who didn't partake in said acts. #qanda
It's good to be the king.   He's not the messiah he's a very naughty boy, now piss off  #qanda
Now if Andrew Bolt had said that... #qanda
Does 3 tweets count as 3 strikes? #QandA
Speaking truth to power...always 'inappropriate'. #qanda
@qanda The point about soldiers raping in Japan was the point where McIntyre lost me. Many Oz solders died horribly as we know.
Ummmm...they did knock on his door in the middle of the night. #qanda
Free speech is not worth a thing if you are not willing to pay the price for it! #QandA
If we're going to talk about follower numbers having meaning, Turnbull RTing to his *363K* follow might have amplified the 'blow up' #qanda
#qanda There has got to be a very real and discernible difference between patriotism and jingoism.
Andrew Bolt's employers must have a very liberal Twitter policy! #qanda
Simple solution is make going to war a matter for public referendum rather than a matter for whichever dingbat holds the PM's office. #qanda
Show me a war where there has been no rape or crime or looting. Has happened amongst us humans since Adam #qanda
#qanda Je suis Scottie !
As well as freedom of speech, we have the right to criticise what others say. #QandA
Seems it is only ok to say harsh things about enemies #qanda
Today I had chilli omelette + toast, potato wedges, Mars pods, haleem, and ful. I am still hungry. #qanda
Did Scott have God in his heart #qanda
Twitter today is definitely an outlet for professionals. Journos represent their institutions and their profession #qanda #ujcomm2567
He should be free to speak - in a room full of soldiers, not behind a keyboard - then see how "appropriate" he thinks it is #qanda
#qanda. McIntyre's comments were too broad and incorrectly all-encompassing.
#qanda should not have Arthur be sacked for poor judgement heading up water holdings
Woah cool it Tim #qanda
McIntyre is one of the finest football reporters Australia has. #Qanda
Was he drunk? #QandA
Employers have a right to ensure their brand isn't damaged by employees social media behaviour #qanda
Ultimately - he's high profile and his Twitter account has SBS all over it... Personal and work aren't separate for him on Twitter #QandA
#qanda McIntyre should not have Tweeted something he wouldn't say on live TV
My friends didn't die face down in the mud for this kind of insensitivity #qanda
Freedom of speech means no government censorship - it doesn't mean you won't get sacked #qanda
Why does Twitter continue to set the agenda?  Less than 10% of Australians actually use it.  Hardly representative.  #qanda
@QandA #QandA You can be a bigot, but don't poke the Patriotism beehive!
Smile Tanya its Q&amp;A  #qanda
Personal opinion needs to be kept personal and business kept as business. There's more into this, we need to be mindful! #qanda
Let's be honest - if he didn't do it on ANZAC day, then would anyone really listen? #qanda #ScottMcIntyre #ScottMcIntyre
Won't condone comments but let him have his opinion for others to debate  #qanda
Oh godddddd here we go #qanda
Worrisome to know the only alternative view around ANZAC has resulted in a punishment. #qanda
Beautiful nuance from Tanya Plibersek on #QandA tonight
Plibersek in one breath calls the Iraq War "Iraq invasion" with anti-war vigour then follows up with nationalist pro-Anzac comment #qanda
All of those atrocities are a part of war. If you think Australians have never taken part in that abuse you are ignorant. #qanda
Plibersek again has no opinion. Wow #qanda
He was sacked because he didn't play ball #qanda
Freedom of speech ?  Do we really have it ? #qanda
When the Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull calls for SBS employed Scott McIntyre to be condemned pretty sure that means fired #QandA
ARE we living in a country where he can say it without a knock on the door? ARE WE? #qanda
How can there be free speech if free speaking threatens your job? #QandA
@QandA #QandA Tanya looks strangely like Julie Bishop
#qanda there's a protest in this country every time tony Abbott ties his shoes up. Out freedom of speech laws are not under threat
Clue- Scott McIntyre doesn't support nationalistic chauvinism, nor make proto-fascist commentary #qanda
#QandA The guy is not in jail or anything like that
#qanda I wish I lived in a country where people were free to knock and ask for help wi/out being gaoled
The problem is that a lot of what @mcintinhos said is TRUE #qanda
One could say it's a journalist's job to bring to light atrocities committed by Australian citizens. #QandA
I should be sacked from my lufe with some of my tweets #qanda
@AliceUribe1 not joining in the #qanda conversation tonight ??
#qanda Plibersek can't bring herself to admit the tweets were anything other than "inappropriate". LOL, our next prime minister.
It is profoundly appalling that @TurnbullMalcolm had a hand in the sacking of Scott McIntyre as Arthur Sinodinos has just indicated  #qanda
Shut up Tim. Calm your farm.  #QandA
#QandA God bless tim fisher
I expect @sbs to be the tv station that airs documentaries on the very subject of #ScottMcIntyre's tweets.  #qanda
Surely the 30,000 Twitter followers are also incredibly irrelevant. Dancing around the issue. #qanda
#qanda No Freedom in a Democracy is Absolute. Every Freedom has a commensurate Responsibility. There's no freedom 2 slander /tell falsehoods
I went to the dawn service, I don't think the Anzac's were saints #qanda
here comes old man yelling at a cloud. #qanda
To be fair, maybe Sinodinos couldn't recall reading that in @crikey_news earlier today. #qanda
Free speech is fair enough. But anyone who makes their employer look bad (in any industry) by their own actions is liable. #qanda
But @tanya_plibersek they DID knock on his metaphorical door in the middle of the night!  #qanda
#qanda Arthur's memory has come back remembering his talk with Malcolm.
Does that mean the MEAA's beliefs contrast with SBS's policies? http://t.co/VPILFcx4CH #qanda #ujcomm2657
Gotta stand with @tanya_plibersek here! #qanda
Thx for the scoop Arthur #qanda
*jowel wobbling intensifies* #qanda
History is written by the winner. Right or wrong. #qanda
Two-up is gambling, folks. They drink beer. It happens. #qanda
Oh spare me #qanda
#QandA our PM has been known to cause offence from time to time.   Whiff of some double standards.
Base on Dr Karl's recent experiences Tanya - that, sadly - that may not be the case #QandA
Are we applying a different standard to staff of public broadcasters compared to other journalists? #QandA @QandA
You have the right to be offended #qanda
#qanda Andrew bolt is more offensive that all journalists on this planet..can we sack him?
Sinodinos has made some poor judgement calls &amp; he still a Senator on the public payroll #qanda
The rape figure might have been overstated, but even if the Anzacs committed  just ONE RAPE, the journalist was right #qanda
Actually they stopped doing that this year. 24 plays Lateline now. @TheSmiddy ABC24 plays it live btw #qanda
Thanks to the men &amp; women of our armed forces.  Your vigilance isn't unappreciated. #QandA
@zippuli @leftocentre you are a person aiming for the bottom. And since you have named shit as coffee, you win. #qanda
@QandA Calm down Tim #qanda
Tanya, yes I think it might be against his workplace policy! #qanda
He may have lost his job but Scott McIntyre appears to have gained a few extra followers #qanda
#qanda in 50 years time, soldiers in the middle east will be glorified, despite the fact that there has been consistent abuse of civilians.
Sod off, Tim Fischer. Signed: a boozer and a gambler who slept in. #qanda
Tim Fischer's not improving. #qanda
He's a shoe-in for a job at ACA! #QandA
so no-one went to the pub and gambled on ANZAC day? no-one had a beer?  pls #qanda
He's Scott no support here #qanda
100th anniversary of Gallipoli landing turned into a "Happy Conservative Myths Day". PS chill out Tim. #QandA
#qanda Footy commentators should stay away from history and politics
Scott McIntyre wasn't denied free speech. He's faced consequences for his remarks but he is free to repeat them should he so wish. #QandA
If you don't love Australia as being what she is as being a great nation that diggers fought to establish. Then bigger off #qanda
Fisher here we go - you never liked the truth  @QandA #QandA
The the train man #qanda
#qanda might be more to this SBS sacking I reckon.
We don't need the SBS  #qanda
So not saying anything in your personal capacity case you get fired isn't a breach of free speech? #qanda
Read SBS's social media protocol. Sacking is not only sanction available to breach. Sacking only for "most serious" cases. #qanda
I thought the Anzacs died for our freedom? #qanda
freedom of speech isn't in our rights, you're thinking of the US #QandA
Angry Tim is angry #qanda
#QandA Oh shut up Fischer
#QandA The question is- have we over stepped the mark in making ANZAC day a national religion and beyond criticism.
Note to self. Never tweet unless you agree with populist opinion... #QandA
Disturbing relationship between nationalism, the ANZACs, drinkers and the Cronulla riots. #auspol #qanda
World War 1, Vietnam, Korea, Iraq... Australia has a shameful track record with its military. People SHOULD be questioning it. #qanda
How can we say we have freedom speech when my prior tweets about qanda using the Avengers symbol have been disregarded? #qanda
Gambling and boozing on ANZAC Day! #qanda
@QandA @tomporteous ... but whistle blowers and public servants have a lot to lose.
Plibersek is a font of wisdom on most issues. Respect.  #qanda
Freedom of speech makes you free... From a paying job #qanda @QandA
@Shaker157 @QandA There are plenty of myths surrounding Gallipoli. Documented ones. But McIntyre's comments were still inappropriate.
I went to a Dawn Service with my kids. We're not boozers or gamblers. #qanda
The jingoistic celebration of what should be a solemn commemoration of a tragedy is distasteful #qanda
Have respect for the death worshippers and martyrs #qanda
@7Spino  @sambleakley1 @krqtv66qi13h @larnie_r @qanda
Charity begins at home. It's pathetic that the Liberal Government cut foreign aid. Yet they ask other countries to show compassion? #QandA
Ironic how suddenly the Left are very interested in preserving #freedomofspeech when one of their own cops heat #McIntyre #qanda
#QandA tanya typical labour attitude , make a decision@was@it right or wrong ?
We must be due for a question or reference about Black Diggers #QandA
Very casual use of the word "democracy" on #qanda tonight. Last time I checked Australia has a queen on its currency
Wow, you're gushing a bit too hard. Better wipe up that drool. #qanda
#qanda  GET OVER YERSELF WALLY
George Brandis' silence has been defeating on #ScottMcIntrye #qanda
Which part of two-up isn't gambling, Tim? #qanda
He spoke. He was sacked. He can still speak. No freedom issue. #qanda
#qanda Australians have no constitutional right to freedom of speech but in any case this sacking is about policy.
@QandA @SigmundMarx he's a very silly man.
It's nice that people question the myth. Well said young man #qanda
#qanda He definitely needed to lose his job. If you can't follow a code of conduct then don't expect to keep the job
I was at the dawn service, but didn't feel as if I was being called a bogan, boozer or gambler. Simply, because I'm not any. #qanda
Women in the military are more likely to be raped than KIA - yet we can't #NameTheProblem as rapist soldiers #QandA
Would a right-wing commentator be sacked for slamming immigration on Australia Day? Or Muslims on Ramadan? My guess is, "No." #QandA
Omg don't ask boomers for opinions on things or stuff. #qanda
"Do you agree with his opinion?" "Um ... no. Nope. I disagree. Please don't fire me." #qanda
Tanya PiginaSak defending Scott Mcintyre's anti-Aus, anti-Anzac comments and says he shouldn't have been sacked! What a vile cunt! #qanda
On #qanda @tanya-plibersek : It's for SBS management to decide if S-McIntyre has breached any workplace policies
Unpopular ideas at unpopular times, the essence of a free society #qanda
Didn't recognise Tim Fischer without his hat #qanda
#qanda
If ppl are going to take offence at someone's opinion, then how wobbly must be their own sense of self? #qanda
Oi Oi Oi Tim #Qanda
Should employees be limited in expressing personal opinions in public in a private capacity? #qanda @QandA
At least he hasn't been hasn't been before ICAC. #qanda
#qanda shit lets hope no one brings up troop behaviours in general........look over there!
Was Scott McIntyre being paid penalty rates on #AnzacDay when he tweeted? No? Then they were personal views unrelated to his work #QandA
#qanda a hundred $million for a museum during a budget emergency, what's going on?  #VillersBretonneux
#qanda @tanya_plibersek displays maturity, balance, class &amp; calm reasoned compassion. Huge contrast to so many on @QandA over the yrs.
If Scott Morrison has his way, We'll have people knocking on the door in the middle of the night in the next budget #QandA
Shouldn't have been sacked. Poor timing of tweet but it told the truth #QandA
there's no bill of rights protecting this man #qanda
Gambling and booze is still synonymous with Anzac Day come on #qanda
#qanda ignorant social comments followed by a large audience is a breach
Too many variables. #QandA
Don't forget that Tim Fischer's passionate response is one side of the same coin on the topic of free speech about the ANZACs. #QandA
There is no argument. You use your employers logo, you abide by their policies, especially on social media. #qanda
If the Anzacs fought for our freedom, @mcintinhos tweets are a part of that freedom, whether we like it or not #qanda
Works the same way if someone is overtly racist or inciting violence. Free to say it. Free to be condemned. That is free speech #qanda
This conversation is dominated by hypocrites. "We don't like what he said" is the only reason people support his sack8ng #qanda
Guess what, we don't give a damn if parade attenders are offended. It's called freedom of speech #qanda
Looking forward to Tim Fischer delivering the closing song. #qanda
Is that an extreme ANZAC view Tim? #qanda
Australia is the largest gambling nation in the world so calling us 'boozers' is incredibly accurate #QandA
Would rather have freedom of speech than dawn services #qanda
Lest we forget who sends us to war. #qanda
No-partisan hypocrisy on display on #qanda #ScottMacintyre
How bland can Tanya be .. She makes Bill look interesting .. #qanda
I feel such a lightness of being choosing not to watch @QandA No angry gesticulating at tv. No angry tweets.
Sbs policy is one thing, this debate is another. The latter is ludicrous next to recent debates re discrimination act changes @QandA #QandA
@AAnagnostellis qanda twitter celebrities!
What that dude said... #qanda
People are free to say what they want but that doesn't absolve them of the consequences of saying it #QandA
#qanda #auspol  #insiders WISH ABC WOULD HAVE THE SAME DECENCY STANDARDS AS SBS LOOK AT THEIR SCUM ? NOT A WORD ? http://t.co/e4DFSJazY1
Offensive remarks about the deaths of 60,000 Australians is not criticism. Its disgusting. #QandA
Employment law will always trump civic freedoms #qanda
Now I don't want to tweet anymore to #QandA just in case someone it causes offence
Orthodoxy is a terrible thing #QandA
The bloke can say what he likes, can't stop him being a bloody idiot. #qanda
Newtons Law : For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. #QandA
Making your personal opinions known on a verified twitter account adorned with SBS logos is like doing a burn out in a company car. #qanda
Scott McIntyre did insult the Anzacs who died so he could he insult them #QandA
People have the right to be a bigot #qanda
Oh for goodness sake. Anyone who doesn't get the responsibility to employer with social media should get another job. Gen Y get it TP #qanda
Aussie troops in WW1 were notoriously insubordinate and that is part of the ANZAC tradition #qanda
Is this really that big an issue. Free speech is what we love remember #qanda
Bottom line the McIntyre issue is now with lawyers. #QandA
Settle Tim. It's not about the dawn service.  #qanda
No glorification of war hahaahah #qanda
Uneducated gamblers can show respect for history just like other Australians.  #qanda
@QandA he's probably already got a job lined up with the greens
#QandA  to paraphrase Brandis everyone has the right to say what they like, make a fool of himself like sidonis on corruption.
Diggers are selling their medals, rising rates of veterans suicide, homeless veterans. Yet everyone is worried about a reporter #QandA
Well said Tim! #qanda
What is most offensive to dead Anzacs is the glorification and fetishisation of this great tragedy #QandA
Andrew Bolt has violated 18C and still has a job #qanda
Lucky Arfur is on the Panel tonight  Talking his Specialities Corruption-Indonesian Judges People Showing Poor Judgement #auspol #qanda
May be Lomberg's Consensus Centre at UniWA can give SBS Scott Macca a job? #qanda

#qanda so who won at 2up?
SBS seemed ok with #ScottMcIntyre until Twitter fired up. #qanda http://t.co/LU9Za4yfK8
Yes. It is offensive. Too bad. #Qanda
Nobody cares what you think you filthy fucking mick Fischer #qanda
#QandA i was at the dawn service &amp; i am not offended by his statements he has the right of free speech which is what the ANZAC;s fought for
Keep #ANZAC a pure death cult #qanda
#qanda why were the Anzacs even in ww1?
#ScottMcIntyre is like the guy that played loud dance music during dawn service in Sydney, just a little troll  #qanda
@Msloulou77 @apicot The memo probably says don't challenge anything official. Stick to the line. #auspol #qanda
@TrackSAFE: TrackSAFE Patron, Tim Fischer, making some very wise statements on #qanda tonight.
We have $5 bet every ANZAC day on there being a glassing in a pub or a brawl, we win every year #qanda
So I guess tony jones doesn't support #AnzacDay as he's an elitist leftist. He says everyone else is a drinker and gambler #qanda
#QandA TimFisher a true australia
@QandA #qanda Sorry Tim but people can disagree with what the ANZAC's did!!
ANZAC Day is about rememberance and respect. #QandA
If #ScottMcIntyre is so embarrassed by the #Anzacs then why does he love in the country they advanced? #qanda #Australia #AnzacDay
#qanda so the ANZACs brought us QandA?!
I did booze and bet on Anzac Day. #QandA
@riteshvarma93 @QandA https://t.co/5KusD5pfST
#qanda I went to the dawn service Tim and I wasn't offended
Freedom of speech or not- a contract is a contract... #QandA #ujcomm2657
#ScottMcIntyre also ignores the human side of ANZAC day. The soldiers gave their health or life. Whether you agree with war or not. #qanda
@riteshvarma93 @QandA I have never heard of Scott McIntyre before tonight. #QandA
@LizTynanTSV @suseDB  I share fear.Too convenient for hearsay on #QandA to keep us quiet while they quietly proceed. I hope I'm wrong #bali9
I was at the #AnzacDay Dawn service. I'm not offended by #ScottMcIntyre 's comments. #QandA
#qanda there is no such thing as freedom of speech and there never truly has been. I can't even talk in the movie theatres!
You're entitled to say what you like on social media, but if you use your real name you need to be accountable #qanda
so you can have free speach except if you work for a commpany? some free speach #qanda
Fallen Anzacs were unfairly dismissed. This guy wasn't... #QandA
Loving the passion from an inspired war veteran! #QandA #ujcomm2657
I don't think the Anzacs were fighting for #qanda Tim Fisher
@QandA poor Tony Abbott got accused of being a boozer for downing a beer. Lots of people need to grow up and get a life
oh my god another old white man angry about conservative military myths. #qanda
What does a fight between Empires have to do with our freedoms? #QandA
Man. Tim Fisher is pissed. #qanda
There was a lot of respect and reverence on ANZAC Day. But the boozing and gambling does exist too... #qanda
Everyone must read this brilliant article by @SusanCarland: http://t.co/A1D53M5o1n #qanda
We celebrate the drinking and gambling that occurs on ANZAC Day #qanda
My great grandfather fought at Gallipoli and I don't think he'd care much what a football commentator is tweeting in 2015. #qanda
#QandA freespeech protects from going to jail, not from sabotaging your own career.
army vet passionately upset over a dig at army... not surprised. #qanda
Voltaire's bastards turned bigots defend @mcintinhos' right to tweet offensively without being sacked by SBS #QandA http://t.co/RaX0o10eNt
imagine if we defended all the minority groups likewise lambasted on twitter like this #qanda
Yay - Tim Fischer !!!! #QandA
I'm pretty sure the Diggers from 1915 didn't want to die so a TV show could go to air 100 yeas later... #qanda
Regardless of freedom of speech, you still need to abide by your employer's social media policies - or else face dismissal #qanda
Calling people drunks is awful. Go to http://t.co/gge5yl5O79 &amp; complain. #qanda
I like the biscuits #qanda
Yes they fought for Scott's right for free speech(?) #qanda
#UJCOMM2657 #QandA Yes he has the freedom to say the things he did, but should have expected and now must deal with the consequences.
Saluting those who made the ultimate sacrifice should be celebrated, not degraded on social media @QandA  #QandA
SBS tweets were so stupid and the post publicity so big, maybe it was a cunning plan to launch http://t.co/G0XOQPjr04 or some such. #qanda

peace and prosperity but don't question any of it #qanda
Seems a bad week for journalists and twitter! Miranda Devine also had a major stuff up, calling auslan clapping "jazz hands" #QandA
This discussion is quite regressive - we shouldn't tweet in fear. #qanda
The Liberal Party  are taking away more from us than then Ottoman empire ever could of dreamed of #qanda
Freedom of speech costs everyone. Being informed is a freebie. #qanda @QandA
@LordTonyofMacca I'm not entirely sure how it works, I heard it while watching QandA. Media circus surrounding them continues
@qanda Here's a question for Arthur Sinodinos. How much is your contracting/advising rates? #qanda
Where did most of those people go after the Dawn service? Most likely to the pub for a few beers and two-up #qanda
Like what Tim Fischer said about not glorifying Anzacs  #qanda
Why not the simple question - was what he said about rape and summary execution factually incorrect? #qanda
#Sinodinos mentions #SBS Managing Dir. #Abeid .. bit close to  #Obeid! #QandA @QandA ..... #AUSPOL #NSWpol
#qanda I went to dawn service - I was not offended by the comments.
Spot on lol RT @croydoncathy: Arthur Sinodinos knows a thing or two about poor judgement #qanda
Scott McIntyre I most certainly am not a boozer or a gambler. How about you stop generalizing everyone? #QandA
#Qanda http://t.co/7Jnzj8a74m
I turned out at the Dawn Service in Sydney - I was shamed that someone was sacked for criticism the official narrative #qanda with facts
"If the freedom of speech is taken away then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter." George Washington #QandA
Sounds like a contractual issue, not a free speech issue. #qanda
SO it comes down to a case of #NotAllAnzacs #qanda
They fought for our freedom of SPEECH @qanda
I was at the dawn service, but didn't feel as if I was being called a bogan, boozer or gambler. Simply, because I'm not one of those #qanda
McIntyre "is Charlie" for posting an opinion. Each year we perpetuate a myth, that myth glorifies war. #qanda
Tim Fischer, what are you raving on about, dude? #QandA
Isn't Mr Fisher the one who wanted to stop ALL NATIVE TITLE RIGHTS for Aboriginal people #qanda
https://t.co/36fQFfa4zq #qanda
@QandA No recognition of #FrontierWars on #AnzacDay
I went to the dawn service and I wasn't offended by those tweets. I'm also not a boozer or gambler &amp; pretty well read. Shame SBS! #qanda
Tim fisher can go suck a dick. #qanda
Not much commercialisation? Hahaha #qanda
Thank god for Tim Fisher... I was starting to lose hope... #qanda
You have the right to say what you want without prosecution but not against being fired. #qanda
So free speech means you can speak without fear of arrest, but any other ways you can be punished for an opinion are fine? #qanda
It's good to know the diggers fought for our right to sack people #qanda
#qanda So if you are a govt employee you can say whatever you want and can never be fired Bc you will scream "my free speech is violated"?
Tim Ferguson unaware of two-up and drinking on #AnzacDay ? #qanda HELLO ?!
#qanda  https://t.co/TgimOCcr7x
Print the legend, the truth isn't wanted on ANZAC Day #qanda
#QandA just makes everyone angry. Come have some fun over @We_Love_Aural instead. It's all unicorns and rainbows, I swear!
I was at the Sydney Dawn Service with my son and I do not consider what Scott McIntyre tweeted was sackable #qanda
War can be a pretty fucked up enterprise, please make a note of it #qanda
When you keep glorifying war, you keep starting or committing lives to them. #QandA
Tim Fisher galloping to the defence of all those brave people fronting up to dawn services. #qanda
#qanda Good to see ol' Arfur Sinodinos' memory has returned. As he forgot so much during #ICAC. Old Uncle Arfur Forgot Alot. #ICACamnesia
Sorry Tim, I didn't find it offensive, don't confuse your experience with that of others. let's not be childish #qanda #auspol
Oh, honestly.. If anyone read those tweets and thought they personal attacks rather than generalisations, they're deluded. #qanda
Well said Tim!!! #qanda
#QandA There's been too much commercialisation of ANZAC.
#qanda apparently everyone should have the right to be a bigot, but criticise Anzac Day and you're the anti-Christ
Twitter Question: Would he have been fired if @TurnbullMalcolm hadn't stepped in? #QandA http://t.co/WT4Qsb5gP6
"No glorification of war", Mr Fischer? Did you HEAR Kevin Andrews at Villers-Bretonneux? #qanda
Let's be honest - if he didn't do it on ANZAC day, then would anyone really listen? #qanda #ScottMcIntyre @SBS
We need to commemorate the days war end, not the start of an invasion. #qanda
You know what is offensive Tim? Talking to those involved in a firefight that killed a colleague and saying "Shit happens" #qanda
So much for the "freedoms" for which our forebears were supposed to have fought. #QandA
I think his remarks were just badly timed, Mal Fraze was unfortunately within wifi range #qanda
Mr Fischer should of seen my mates and I are after dawn service, he might think twice about us not being boozers and gamblers #qanda
#qanda #McIntyre defamed people who died years ago. It was in bad taste. Should we all lose our jobs for doing the same?
I had a lovely sleep in on Saturday morning. Just saying. #qanda
#Corruption #QandA #auspol https://t.co/mpR51wmPLF
Anzac Day is anti war and so is Scott McIntyre #qanda
I agree with McIntyre's sentiment in general, but he was too crass and that's where he really failed #qanda
Imagine if we were as passionate about human rights and minority groups as we are about the ANZACs #QandA
that girl has good eyebrows hi  #qanda
Oh yes because I, a 17 year old girl am both an alcoholic and a gambler because I went to a dawn service @qanda #qanda
I did see people sleeping on the graves of diggers at Anzac ceremonies in Gallipoli on TV.  Maybe he had a point #ScottMcIntyre #QandA
George Brandis would have LOVED the @ScottDMacIntyre tweets #QandA #AusPol @QandA
#qanda It is not only our right, but our responsibility to criticise government decisions, especially when it comes to involvement in wars
Let's not have .5 million in litigation... Instead, let's have 350 million in myth building! #qanda
#qanda The foul mouthed responses to the journo's tweets gave a good indication of the type who were offended.
Want to understand Anzac Day? Think back to what Anzac Day was like in 1919. #qanda
@kristytrajcevs1 @QandA You could get a job in an Indonesian abottior.
He stated an historical fact. Why so scared? #qanda
If you go to a dawn service dressed head to toe in green and gold, yeah, nah #qanda
To me, Anzac Day has long been about reflecting on the futility of war as much as acknowledging past sacrifices. #qanda #LestWeForget
Don't challenge conventional wisdom on the internet #qanda
Journalists play devil's advocate all the time #QandA
@QandA how can Sinodinos say @mcintinhos wasn't a journo? He was and just happened to specialise in football #qanda #auspol  @independentaus
Unless we know the exact details of the employment contract we must be careful to say he broke it. #QandA
Has anyone considered his mental health? His comments were Un-Australian #Qanda
Looks like Scott Mcintyre got "ANZAcked" from his job @QandA #qanda
So gov seems to be gloating over McIntyre's sacking. #qanda
Fire up Fisher! #qanda
On #qanda @tanya_plibersek : It's for SBS management to decide if S-McIntyre has breached any workplace policies
Hardly a day of quiet reflection anymore. #qanda
@QandA Capital punishment is always political.  Nothing to do with crime prevention.
Jesus we think too highly of journalists  #qanda
As a journalist it's a wake up call, ask the question, but make sure it's in line with your employees policies #QandA
everyone at the dawn service is a straight up patriot and you cann't ever say anything that upsets them #qanda
Let's be clear #McIntyre wasn't a journalist #qanda
The dawn services were fantastic. That doesn't mean the people they're dedicated to are free from criticism or inquiry, though. #qanda
Now Tim Costello is saying we are safe and prosperous because we attacked Turks at Gallipoli? #qanda
@tiddlesemp @QandA Been asking this all day.
Shut up and don't question the myth #QandA
Yeah mate if we didn't invade Gallipoli the Turks would have come over here and stopped us from showing #qanda ... Totally
#QandA Andrew Bolt wasn't sacked for his comments about indigenous people that were printed in national paper for which landed him in court
We all need to show some responsibility #qanda
#qanda opinions are not right nor wrong.. They are just opinions! Get a grip!
@QandA good on us Tim. My father was a war hero but NEVER spoke of it. It's not war glorification
You gutless jellyfish, @tanya_plibersek! Only thing you can say about the vile ANZAC tweets was that they were "inappropriate". #qanda
Tim needs to go back into politics #qanda @QandA #couldteachabbottathingortwo
Of course journalists need to ask questions and begin conversations. But using sensitivity and intelligence helps. #qanda
But I AM a boozer and a gambler. #qanda
He did raise an important point #qanda
Someone thinks Twitter is way more important than it is. #QandA
#QandA Time for an ICAC question for Arthur.
#QandA if anything, the focus on the tweets has brought it to more people's attention
#QandA angries up the blood
It is not offencive from a family member of founders  the order Australiasian old bastards club #qanda there are facts
McIntyre was offensive but he can say it. Just like, Bolt, Deane etc. #qanda
#qanda   modern journalism....  make way for it.... :)
This journalist simply shared his opinion. Let's face it both sides died for a stupid political agenda #QandA
Scott McIntyre's spray reminds me how much dissent has faded in our country. #qanda
Even if SBS thought contrary to policy , you don't sack someone on spot @QandA #qanda
How is calling ANZACS gamblers and boozers offensive. An ANZAC day tradition is going to the pub to have a beer and a game of 2 up #qanda
Anzac Day does not glorify war, it remembers how atrocious it was #QandA
It does has to be said that anyone who thinks All the ANZACs were holier than though saints is no doubt kidding themselves. #QandA
#qanda ROFL Tim Fisher is such a dickhead!
The first casualty of war is the whole truth #qanda
I really think that should have been taken as a comment... #qanda
Don't debunk the myth Scott McIntyre. #qanda
'no glorification of war' the bloke stands up and says about a public holiday aimed at the glorification of war #qanda
To question the narrative is seen as "unAustralian". ANZAC Day commemorates a useless waste of life, not sacrifice for freedom #qanda
There's a difference between free speech and being mature #qanda
The Anzac legend has become nationalistic propaganda.Scott McIntyre was mostly accurate, he is promoting an anti war platform!!! #qanda
Kids can have no idea what war really means. Children must question militaristic national myths. But they should respect sacrifice. #qanda
If you find offending national myths more outrageous than offensive national myths, it's time to to rethink your outrage barometer. #QandA
#qanda how to you honour a practitioner and not glory the practice. How do you honour a murderer and abhor the murder?
Arthur Sinodinis says Scott McIntyre took advantage of his SBS profile to reach large audience. Exactly like Andrew Bolt did. #qanda
McIntyre has freedom to tweet what he likes. Also free to walk up to his boss and tell him to "f*** off." Both have consequences. #qanda
Twitter doesn't start ANY important conversations! #QandA
Tim Fischer manages to string regional town names into every answer  #qanda
@QandA #qanda lest we forget the horror of war. Not lest we forget the fallen
My mutes have disappeared! Suddenly qanda tweets! :(
#qanda please in future leave the deputy opposition leader off the show .....talk about dancing around every question!!!
Not mentioning the darker side to war and impact of combat missions is ignorant, too. #qanda @QandA #ujcomm2657
#qanda hypocrite Tim Fischer with your taxpayer funded $4.3 million venture Vatican City #auspol
*this tweets content has been deleted* #QandA
QandA. Blah blah blah.
What if Mcintyre's tweets had been pro war, encouraging people to arms &amp; killing those foreign devils? Would he still have a job? #qanda
The man is not a journalist, he's a sports commentator, mutually exclusive #qanda
Wanna keep ya job, watch what ya write on Social Media!! #QandA
This assertion that 'we' wouldn't exist today if it weren't for the Anzacs is ridiculous and cannot be proven #qanda
The ANZACS got drawn in to conflicts that they often knew little about, doing what they thought was right. They deserve respect. #qanda
Tim Fischer just said the ANZACs fought for the freedoms of people...which absolves them of critique #qanda
Tel me how sacrificing Australians at Gallipoli helped preserve our way of life in Melbourne?  #qanda
What exactly was the threat to Australia's social freedoms in 1914? @QandA
Interesting to hear those on the conservative side hurt by offensive language lashing out wanting it banned. #qanda
Anzac Day is a bit weird to be fair. #qanda
Watch Tim Fischer blow a poofer valve! Has Tim read Scott's contract? Ill-informed &amp; OTT outrage over tweets is disgusting!  @QandA #qanda
Tens of thousands may have come out for dawn services on a public holiday, but there are 23million people in this country #QandA
Understand why McIntyre was sacked but not why Bernardi maintains Tony Abbott's support after equating gay marriage with bestiality #qanda
#ScottMcIntyre didn't say everyone, he referred to a few, Tim Fisher you pompous git. #qanda
#Qanda News Corp must have a lax policy if Andrew Bolt, Miranda Devine and Tim Blair haven't been sacked for their heinous tweets yet.
Freedom of speech is a responsibility to have thick enough skins to ignore things you don't like. Not whine about it. #Qanda
Don't think #ScottMcIntyre's comments were at all a proper way to start a mature conversation about Anzac Day. #qanda
We need to be able to talk about ANZAC mythology without immediately shutting it down calling 'disrespect' #qanda
How do you glorify the death of a loved one who served and protected his country? We don't we go our him or her #qanda
#qanda of course the veteran would stand up for the glorified fiction.
Too many variables. #QandA
What is it about the winners writing the history books? #qanda
#QandA it's a curse to be young and stupid
#QandA sorry Tim but the fact that ANZAC day glorifies war cannot be denied.
Could have been a lot more robust if #alp had not sold the Crown Jewels and made #Aus a poor state #auspol #qanda https://t.co/XCd14I0D2j
Hey, let's lay off the boozers and the gamblers. They make Australia great. #qanda
Now hey, let's not confuse a legend with a cult. #QandA
I'd like to see Scott McIntyre make the ultimate sacrifice like those brave ANZAC men did.. #qanda @QandA
Why does everyone tiptoe around the real issue? We can condemn Indonesia for exciting people but we don't let people tweet? #qanda
If that's the case, #MirandaDevine should be sacked for her stupidity #qanda
Should I have some toast with butter and white sugar yarm &lt;3 #qanda
The ANZAC industry is at stake #qanda
"A way to do these things and a way not to do these things" doesn't sound like free speech to me. #qanda
#qanda @QandA what about our future will not be there if we turn our backs on refugees
The Anzacs are dead, which is why we can now do what we like with them. #QandA
Everyone wants to start a conversation, anyone going to finish one? #qanda
Dawn services give Tim Fischer hope for the nation. Or something. #qanda
Thousands also attended two up at the pub without attending the dawn services! ANZAC bingeing is enormously problematic #qanda
His tweets started the questions on  @QandA tonight #QandA
Tim's right. Thousands turned up to Anzac services. That's respect, not jingoism #qanda
Fair Work Ombudsman may yet have the last say on the sacking #QandA
How about we celebrate a day like the end of world war 2 instead! Peace instead of contentious issues about imperialism #qanda
How do Bolt, Jones and the like get away with saying dumb stuff all the time? #qanda
Where would the wealthy privileged class be without their brave heroes to risk their lives for them? For blind-sighted glory? #qanda
Tim Fisher is by far the smartest person in this room! #qanda
Don't question the narrative or be sacked.  Sounds like democracy to me. #qanda #auspoI
Dawn Service is one thing. But there is definitely an ugly boganisation of ANZAC Day is Aus. #qanda
Curious: who out there was actually personally offended by the tweets? Or just worried that other people would be? #qanda
@QandA Not sure what they mean by the comments taking off on twittersphere. I'll ride with you went viral.This didn't even create a sneeze.
Tim Fischer pulls out the can of whitewash and gets to work #qanda
#qanda Sanctimonious reactions to McIntyre's personal tweets by many who jumped to Charlie Hebdo cartoonists' defence. Hypocrisy!
@QandA Journalists need to bring these subjects to the public domain
So the Comms Minister rings a public funded broadcaster's boss to alert him to an employee's tweet &amp;there's no pressure implied?  #QandA
Hey we got up early! How dare you make us look at things in anything other than black and white McIntyre! #QandA
Yes, but he's lost his bloody job! #qanda
Boozing is obvs part of the Aussie spirit. Just ask @TonyAbbottMHR #qanda
All the old Anzacs always said, never never glorify war #qanda
So we will stick up for bigots by trying to dismantle the anti-discrimination act yet we attack #ScottMcIntrye. Hypocrisy much? #QandA
#qanda Name calling is never an appropriate way to "start a conversation".
Freedom is being too scared to speak out. Freedom is self-censorship #qanda
I love ANZAC day - I brought a T-shirt and a ticket to an arena spectacular to prove it #qanda
#QandA  I love the straightforward, no-nnosense talk that Tim Fischer gives us.
Lolz. Democracy. Yeah. Who is this fucking dopey bitch ? #qanda
Can we really describe ranty tweets as journalism? (If yes, remind me to join MEAA) #qanda
Err isn't the ANZAC tradition to go to the pub and play two up. Like he said. #qanda
@QandA @TurnbullMalcolm One would hope.
We hard stopped fighting since WW1. Is it too sacred to ask if Australia has become a warring nation? #qanda
This whole thing with the SBS guy has been thrown way out of proportion. #qanda
#QandA  He must have had too many beers. Or played too much two-up.
I didn't know who this guy was until it blew up in the media today. #qanda
@QandA #qanda Was what he said factually wrong? Apart from generalizing?
Will I be fired one day for criticising how awful Tony Abbott was as our PM? #QandA
So Tanya's not offended by Mcintyre's tweets. Core value missing ?  #Qanda
"This guy" has a name #qanda
#QandA Go Tim!!! Loving Ur opinions and points of view. Consider a political comeback?
This could be news to some, but Australia doesn't have a monopoly on all that's good in war.  #QandA
If you can't handle truth twitter, stick to Disney Facebook #qanda
It's considerably more offensive how our current Governor General was involved in a VB advertising campaign that used ANZAC Day #qanda
Beer ads made on top of the ANZAC myth are way more offensive. #qanda
#qanda Pliberseck supports SBS journo who denigrates Australia another reason she is unfit as a politician
What has been tweeted cannot be untweeted. #QandA
@QandA When will you display images on TV? #QandA #ANZAC http://t.co/6laAnkt4n2
I ask important questions all the time, like how much wine is heart healthy #qanda
A journalist tells stories not random poorly timed offensive opinion pieces #qanda
Speech isn't free if it costs you your livelihood #qanda
Scott McIntyre I'll tweet with you (but not your content) #qanda
Well Timbo, the actual Anzacs had no interest in returning to commemorate Anzac Cove #qanda
I support Scott McIntyre's right to be 'offensive'. But SBS also has the right to enforce a social media policy. #qanda
He better not slander Christmas as well #qanda
Free speech but no free tweet #qanda
It does have to be said that anyone who thinks All the ANZACs were holier than though saints is no doubt kidding themselves. #QandA
"Not being prosecuted" he just got sacked, love #QandA
There's nothing wrong you just lose your job #qanda
The one thing I like about #QandA is the intelligent questions from the bright young people in the audience
"(McIntyre) does have free speech, but he erred in the way he went about it." #QandA @QandA http://t.co/UwlOwJvxFn http://t.co/9wHwz3xmDW
Meanwhile... Bolt &amp; Alan Jones will be back tomorrow. #QandA
#qanda many people go to dawn service to hope that we don't forget that war kills. Not just to commemorate ANZACS.
"This guy"? He has a name lady in pale blue. #qanda
BILL OF RIGHTS #qanda
I'm not convnced that battle of Gallipoli was a fight FOR Australia &amp; that it gave us this lifestyle #qanda
The best way to be able to say whatever you want online? Use a pseudonym #qanda
Be specific about the historical inaccuracies and go from there #QandA #freespeech
@QandA #qanda Please recognise that the way that Oz now celebrates ANZAC has troubled many Australians. That is obviously ok.
The better way is to do what Bolt did &amp; just make things up. #qanda
Academic says "this guy." Are you really an academic? #qanda
@QandA hes been demonized
Can someone please tell Caroline Holbrook "this guy's" name? #qanda
#qanda only if you're one of the anointed journalists can you run your ideas
#qanda but we are Gamblers thanks to Tony Abbots support for the Gambling Lobby Re Pokies &amp; Casinos!
Twitter is great for creating debate but appalling in how abusive it can be. #QandA
Yeah we all need to hear what young sports journalists think of century old conflicts. That's the essence of democracy #qanda
No glorification of war, says Tim Fischer. "Magnificent defeat", says @TonyAbbottMHR #qanda
#QandA Military jingoism on April 25 is getting ridiculous, for the other 364 days of the year this issue wouldn't have rated? Hypocrisy?
I'm glad the young questioners in the #qanda audience are on the ball.
Who knew this guy b4 Anzac Day  #qanda
Too late to save the Anzacs from commercialisation #qanda
ANZACs aren't drunks because the pubs are closed until midday. #Qanda
#qanda Funny how Zoo magazine officials get off so lightly
All talk and no pay makes Scott a poor boy #QandA #AusPol
That's why most professionals have "these views are my own, not my employers " attached to my profile #qanda
Don't say on social media what you wouldn't say face to face. #qanda
@qanda - timing was all wrong - slagging off Aussies on ANZAC DAY is bad timing.
HIROSHIMA AND NEGASAKI WERE TERRORIST ATTACKS. #qanda
I bet you 10 bucks Scott isn't happy about loosing his job......oh wait #ujcomm2657 #qanda
I find the PM knighthood of Phillip on Australia Day offensive #qanda
#QandA well at least #ScottMcIntyre has sparked the conversation tonite about #freespeech and a sober look at #ANZAC, the journo job is done
With Free speech comes great responsibility #QandA
Free speech is really only an option for the self employed. #qanda
Cuts to aid budget impact on development in countries like Nepal, affecting local capacity to respond to events such as this #QandA
guys   we DONT actually have an express right to freedom of speech in aus #qanda @qanda
Who would be a journalist these days; jailed for free speech or jailed for doing ur job! #qanda
https://t.co/Z62gcN7lpr #qanda the real question is our free speech on those that speak about our wars #assange
'there's a way to do these things' don't ever ever say the truth, everything is fine, journalists must never say the truth #qanda
Sports journalists are a few chops short of BBQ though. Everyone knows that. #qanda
He wouldn't have said it in front of a camera. #qanda
'Let us not waste half a million on litigation'. Yeh let's not let the courts adjudicate on little issues like FOS in a democracy #qanda
ANZAC day has turned into a celebration of war rather than commemoration of the acts of the dead. #qanda
Sinodinos lies straight-out being official SBS tweet, then Fischer wraps himself in the flag - yup, that's typical. #qanda
Freedom of speech was only intended for political standpoints rather than opinions... #qanda
#qanda its not free speech if you lose your job and get lambasted on national tv
He was a sports journalist for goodness sake. Seriously. #qanda
Given Australia's drinking culture not sure if boozer is incorrect #QandA
I should be sacked from my life with some of my tweets #qanda @qanda
Let's boycott Woolworths for "Fresh in our memories"? #qanda
#qanda wowsers still exist sadly
Freedom of Speech.  Free for some.  Costly for others.   #QandA
Hmmm, never really thought of it that way... #qanda
@QandA @tomporteous so a sports reporter can't have an opinion other than anything sports related.  Shame on sbs for banning free speech
make statements as a journalist but make educated informed statements #qanda #freespeech #ScottMcIntyre
Tony is on fire tonight. I'm pissing myself. So funny. QandA
Meanwhile aboriginal diggers are still banned from marching in Anzac marches. The victor writes history and it mustn't be trusted #qanda
Anzac Day is SOOO important, that they took away the public holiday for it in NSW! @QandA
Print the legend, the truth isn't wanted on ANZAC Day #qanda
All opinions are equal, but some are more equal than others #qanda #ujcomm2657
Free speech doesn't equal no consequences #QandA #ujcomm2657
The conversation relevance isn't the issue, him being sacked shouldn't be the issue - tact and humility and his lack of facts are! #QandA
Journo Scott McIntyre was out of line. His comments were offensive considering the events &amp; anniversary of ANZAC. He got off lightly #QandA
@AustProtParty Course not, freedom of speech = for lefties and their radical views Hate speech = anything that opposes that #auspol #qanda
#qanda Stop commemorating the past &amp; lets build the future pleeaase!!!!!
....As we sleep go to bed tonight thousands of veterans are homeless. Sen. Arthur S what are we doing about that?  #qanda
Looks like Scotty Mcintyre got "ANZACked from SBS @QandA #qanda
So when the Communications Minister rang SBS to dob on Scott McIntyre &amp; called for his condemnation he didnt mean to fire him? LOL! #QandA
Jihadists? What? #qanda
So  WE   MUST ALL think as  ONE #qanda ? not bloody likely
Should Anzac biscuits contain coconut? That's the real Anzac Day debate. #YesToCoconut #QandA
so if you don't bat for team Australia you are not allowed to play.. #qanda
Anzac day is sadly now a public domain brand @qanda
Perhaps Scott McIntyre should have  tweeted about the sporting history of the ANZACS. Cricket and football was played in Egypt.  #qanda
No carnivalization? Tim I'm sorry but did you stop by any pub in the country? #qanda @QandA
Why did Turnbull think it was his right to phone the head of SBS #qanda
#qanda OK: McIntyre has not been jailed for saying what he thought: but he has lost his livelihood
Wow Tim Fisher says that the #Anzacs died so that we could have #QandA. Yeah. Ok.
Our participation in WWI did not contribute to our freedom or our ability to be on #QandA
#Qanda Scott McIntyre should now be given a high paying career as a media "shock jock"
since when does your employer have the right to punish you for your opinion ? #qanda
#qanda but we won't debate Anzac day in the interests of covering our daily lies.
Lest we forget the massacre of The FIRST Australians fighting for their country in the Frontier Wars #qanda
journalist should list journals not tweet #qanda
There is a great difference between starting a discussion and starting a fight. #qanda
#qanda Sorry Fisher, 2 tours in Vietnam,  was at the dawn service and McIntosh's comments didn't bother me.
@martiandrivein what u think of #qanda tonight?
#qanda Onya Tim @QandA qanda
#qanda We here in Australia seem to treat Gallipoli as a victory, when it was actually a crushing defeat.
#qanda The Federal government. A fascist government by any other name
#qanda Criticising ANZAC is practically a crime these days. Don't tell me what I can think!
But Journos can call to throw the PM out to sea in a bag #qanda
#qanda He was fired for a breach in his workplace code. Move on.
No, no one is confused on this subject. It's pretty clear. #QandA
What? Talking about Hiroshima and Nagasaki creates jihadists? That's a big leap. #qanda
How would our freedoms be diminished if all those soldiers hadn't been slaughtered? #qanda
#qanda speech is free but you'll have to pay for it...
Anzackery - a frightening new Australian religion deserves scrutiny like any religion #qanda
Yeah, isn't it the role of sport commentators to rile up the masses? #qanda
But were his tweets factually correct?  #qanda
Are these views really considered extreme? Jeez, good thing you guys never came to any anarchist collective meetings #qanda
Man, imagine if people got this fired up about the dehumanisation of the refugees. #qanda
Anzac Day is not a celebration. It is a commemoration of an avoidable and complete waste of life. #qanda
Hey Boss, I love you and love working here. #qanda
@QandA Attending dawn services in the pissing rain does not signify respect to diggers. It's fulfilling an ideal.
Fired for not deleting tweets? #qanda
With no consideration of the context, social media is the best way for democracy to thrive. Open conversation and free speech ftw #qanda
Were Hiroshima and Nagasaki not terrorist attacks? They wiped two cities off the map. #qanda
#qanda Umm yes. Bombing cities out of existence IS an act of terrorism.
Mass generalisations about people who gave their life for us are slander and anti-Australian #qanda
So knowing the truth creates jihadists? #qanda
How did we just get to jihadists? #qanda
War is terror #qanda
Populist opinion band wagon #qanda
It could be said the SBS reporter insulted his own 30 thousand followers who would be mostly sports followers #qanda @QandA
What about the slaughter of millions of Jews in WW2? #qanda
I became a jihadist because an SBS sports reporter went nuts on twitter dot com #qanda
ALWAYS Question the narrative @QandA #qanda
Now that link to jihadists is a stretch. #qanda
Big difference between journalist and sports reporter and op Ed writer #qanda
Freedom of speech was only intended for political standpoints.... #qanda
#QandA what drugs is she on???
@QandA #QandA Honestly did it raise to a level of bigotry which Brandis said we have a right to do. #McIntyre #ANZAC
Stop the tweets #qanda
Linking the tweet to jihadists is far more dangerous #QandA
I think 'mature democracy' went out the window when he made one big value judgement over a great collection of people. #qanda
#QandA  I'm over ANZAC Day it feels like brainwashing and indoctrination
@JB_AU @QandA In a word, yes !
@QandA How free is Australia ?
#qanda how is this even worthy of debate, given over 8000 lost their lives at Gallipoli?
The tweets were a degrading generalisation, yet they highlight a side of war and our commemoration of it we would prefer to forget #QandA
#qanda nuclear bombs use are not terrorist attacks?  Seriously. Totally immoral.
Well at pubs, there is 2up and drunkiness #qanda
#QandA Japan started it we finished it
I agree with his tweets. The way he worded them? Not so much. #qanda
Australians want a..  FEDERAL ICAC NOW!! #FEDERALICACNOW  PSE RT #auspol #qanda http://t.co/GWOfjqNdHk
Why not punish people who make racist remarks on social media as well then? #ujcomm2657 #qanda
'Free speech or no job' on #ScottMcIntyre says #QandA host @TonyJones_qanda
Well said, Tim Fischer, with right proportion of indignation #qanda
America deliberately targetted civilians with those two bombs. Not military targets. Civilians. Terrorism. #qanda
While the ANZAC myth is important, it must not be used to fuel jingoism. This destroys everything that the diggers fought for!! #qanda
Important for democracy to air unpopular opinions but also important to treat people with respect. #qanda
If he can't respect the ANZACs, who can he respect? Certainly not his employers or colleagues... Certainly not you and me #qanda
@qanda people forget and history repeats. #qanda
A week of wall to wall war propaganda will do that to a bloke #qanda
Scott McIntyre is no journalist and not going to jail. Free speech does exist but when your employer has guidelines, don't break them #qanda
#qanda not imprisioned but sacked!
Carolyn Holbrook makes good point that free speech does still exist for #ScottMcintyre. Lefties confusing issue as usual. #QandA
#qanda When will we acknowledge the truth that the reputation of the WW1 soldiers in Egypt was so bad that we weren't welcome there in WW2
Everything SBS does gives fuel to critics of SBS. There's no hope for them if they're devoted to placating those who hate them #qanda
Does a plummeting #AustralianAid budget worry you? Send a letter to @JoeHockey now about it: http://t.co/b6xpALsuMh #QandA
@QandA was it ok for @ABCNews24 presenters to talk about the gallipoli service pre-cursor as "pre-match" entertainment? #qanda
#QandA Words can be more dangerous than atomic bombs #QandA
There you go @mcintinhos, you got fuck all support/sympathy from the #qanda panel. Get a new job - don't suck from the public teat anymore.
If you don't tweet a popular opinion, you are inevitably going to be ridiculed #ujcomm2657 #qanda
We need to remember the #Anzacs to learn lessons from our past #QandA #selfreflection
@QandA @tanya_plibersek Take the aid from Indonesia and give the $600m to Nepal
ANZAC Day should be about remembering how TERRIBLE war is. It should serve as a pledge of "never again". #qanda
Nice work #qanda. 7 out of 7 tweets in a row were anti-ANZAC.
Timing is everything. #qanda
With the mention of the term "sphere" it becomes harder and harder to work out if #qanda is a TV show or a uni tutorial
Imagine if we fired every journalist who upset a segment of society with facts or fiction #qanda
#qanda employers beware social media like many things can be used for good or evil.
@cescabroome #qanda
The western world are historically the greatest terrorists of them all #qanda
What. How do the tweets encourage jihadism. Please explain @QandA #qanda
If you work for a network that seeks to promote inclusiveness &amp; multiculturalism, perhaps don't promote an 'us &amp; them' mentality. #qanda
Great point made by @TheRealPBarry earlier. Free speech gives you a limited right not to be jailed, shouldn't protect your job  #qanda
Commemorate war, don't celebrate it. #qanda
#qanda Sounds like he is a traitor...shoot him too. #qanda
Every ANZAC day I kill and rape someone #qanda
#qanda my father 96 said all he cared about was remembering his lost mates. It was just to be a simple day to think back.
omg #qanda just now suggested that #scottmcintyre is fuelling the jihad
So nuking a country isn't a terrorist attack??? #qanda
History is written by the victor #qanda @QandA
What?! That's a long bow to draw. Outrageous #QandA
How do you glorify the death of a loved one who served and protected his country? We don't we honour, him or her on ANZAC day #qanda
Sorry but I can't even fathom this discussion. We have a fairytale about war and death. The least we should do is be critical #qanda
@michaelaarghh part of the reason I'm finding this whole QandA conversation regarding it so amusing.
@QandA he made a mistake. Forgive. We can't even forgive a tweet yet want others to forgive drug dealers who knew the consequences.
@QandA seems like Arthur's Sinodinos memory has improved significantly since his court case in.ICAC.
Freedom of speech does not guarantee employment #qanda
Great question. As journalists we should be asking tough questions to conversation going. But we also have to be accurate! #qanda
Oh please, right wing critics of SBS hardly need a lot of fuel. #qanda
The second bomb should never have been dropped. Japan was ready to surrender. #qanda
SBS was created to provide Australians with alternative points of view. #ScottMcIntyre did this. #QandA
Both nukes were terror. As were fire bombs in Dresden and Japan @QandA #QandA
@QUIGGYPAULS I agree with you. They are willing to offended. #QandA
One person's terrorist is another's freedom fight #qanda
Such a ridiculous stretch that his tweets are making teenagers become jihadists.... #qanda
Tim Fisher in form. fantastic. holding the line, changing the subject, making good unrelated points in support. #qanda
If Iraq and Afghanistan didn't need help from western countries to depose Dictators etc why are there so many 'refugees'?  #qanda #auspol
#qanda How are Hiroshima and Nagasaki not terrorist attacks?
To see a summary of my thoughts, refer to my Twitter feed from this afternoon. #qanda
Why is this guy Sinodinis who is under an ICAC cloud lecturing us about morals on #qanda
How did the convo from #ScottMcIntyre turn to ISIS? #QandA
@QandA 10 years ago I thought the death penalty justified. Now I believe it's wrong. In 10 years time, I'd guess Indonesia will catch up.
Andrew Bolt actually broke the law and faced no employment consequences #QandA
#QandA if it was not terrorism what was it? we dropped a bomb &amp; killed many
Jones.....free speech doesn't mean you can say whatever you like without consequences. #qanda
Come on #qanda get on with decent questions about economy, jobs
Most Australians are threatened and intimidated by their employers. Fear is the reason why the ABC is a now shadow of its  past glory #qanda
@qanda funny how the free speech wasn't being embraced by labor when Andrew bolt was being sued
No. No no no. Twitter does not create terrorists out of young people. No. #qanda
Australia: The thin-skinned country. #Qanda
Are we now debating the validity of the bombing of Nagasaki maybe we should focus on more contemporary issues #qanda
I was thinking of watching SBS, but now I'm not so sure #qanda
"Hey Scott, you're getting the Naga-SACK-i!" #qanda
Let's get real here - we get involved in many wars that we have no business being part of. Where is the glory and bravery in that? #qanda
Will John Pilger be now appointed the new SBS sports journalist? #qanda
Pretty sure the Japanese civilians who were blown to bits would consider Hiroshima terrorism. #qanda @QandA
People are confusing freedom of speech with exemption from consequence #qanda #ScottMcIntyre
@TurnbullMalcolm should man up and admit that he got Scott McIntyre fired for saying things Malcolm didn't like. Pathetic! #qanda
#qanda Isn't the problem that every journalist now expresses their opinion rather than quoting others who have an opinion?
Well, only one power has ever stopped so low as to actually use nuclear weapons in war. Hmmm. #qanda
the political correctness is overwhelming #qanda
So if you criticise Aus involvement in war then you're a jihadist? OK #qanda
#qanda Free speech = terrorism. Got it.
Who is this idiot? The atomic bombs dropped on Japan were indeed indiscriminate war crimes in civilians. #qanda
I think the real reason he was fired is because SBS is going through budget cuts and will use any excuse to fire someone/save money #QandA
@LindaWhiteASU yep, &amp; s'one just mentioned here it's interesting how he has far fewer memory probs on #qanda than at #ICAC
Freedom of speech ends when you lose your job for daring to exercise it #qanda
That's a long bow to draw, jihadists to anzac comments. Nice try. #qanda
#qanda "Their service, so we can be here today" blah blah "turns kids extreme" blah blah. Awful sad nonsense arguments.
talking about the nagasaki and hiroshima actually causes terrorist attacks in the upside down world of #anzac #logic #qanda
They were bombs upon citizens unnecessarily. How absurd that we are offended instead by the language with which we describe them. #qanda
You mean Anzac Day (tm) (R) (copyright) ? #QandA #brandzacday
#qanda when was state terrorism excluded from terrorism.
It wasn't about creating discussion, it was purely tweeted to offend. He breached his contract... Ciao #ScottMcIntyre #qanda
Whaaat? Nagasaki was horrific &amp; killed tens of thousands of civilians! #QandA
This panel is afraid of controversy. #qanda
"The magnificence of those dawn services" says Tim Fisher. That's exactly the problem. #qanda There is nothing 'magnificent' about Gallipoli
how absurd.. Jihadists from tweets about ANZAC? #qanda
atomic bombs are terror weapons. it's their entire point of existence #qanda
Terrorism is attack on civilians. So was fire bombing of Dresden. Unnecessary. #qanda
@QandA #QandA Tim Fischer, you are a legend. No question, you are just a legend.
If you don't think those bombs are war crimes then you're a fucking revisionist waste of space. #qanda
On #qanda @tomporteous re WWII attacks on Japan - were war crimes
Terrorism actually has a definition and not much of the panel knows it #QandA
Strange. A critic of abs doesn't necessarily have to be right wing? #qanda
Freedom of speech can be a great thing and a terrible. That's why it's called freedom of speech... #qanda @QandA
We still have 3.5 years of World War One 100 anniversaries to go. There'll be lots more commentary on the commentary to come. #qanda
You're kidding. Disagreeing with ANZAC narrative gives fuel to potential jihadists? #qanda
Hiroshima was a 'terrorist' attack when you consider that Hiroshima was not a military target #qanda
What is more offensive is that after 100 years governments worldwide have learnt nothing and still send our young men n women to war. #qanda
Killing innocent civilians in the masses = terrorism in my book #qanda
@tmc071 And many others... #Murdoch journos have a much lower bar, I think they get bonuses for causing offence. #QandA
Great to have my tweet read out by Tony, I will sleep the sleep of the pleased, tonight!  #qanda
So why does Bolt who's convicted of a crime have a job and McIntyre get fired ? Ask Malcolm Turnbull #QandA #quanda
Ughhhhhhhhhh of course someone is going to bring up 'jihadists'. QandA could be about chocolate and someone would bring up jihad. #QandA
Lets not forget Nelson Mandela was considered a terrorist - depending on your point of view #qanda
Anzac Day is what it is. Just let it go. #QandA
They were acts of war. Those partaking in terrorism now would describe themselves as warriors of their beliefs. #qanda
@nichmelbourne @qanda Yes, but that clown referred to ANZAC as a myth.. Ask my dead great uncles if their death in battle was a myth #qanda
I think it was about mateship &amp; being born. RT @KieraGorden I thought our soldiers died so that we could have free speech? #QandA
@QandA freedom of speech is measured by Andrew Bolt !!
One man's terrorism is another man's freedom fighter. #qanda
Criticising the bombs dropped in Japan does not lead people to become jihadists? What the fuck? #qanda
His judgement was poor, but none of our actions at war should be above questioning #qanda
I've been attending ANZAC services for years. Not yet heard nationalist or jingoistic speech yet #qanda
@QandA #qanda Hiroshima was chosen because weather was clear and US could monitor their experiment. How noble!
We all have a right to free speech but you will be ostracised from society if you do exercise that right #qanda
Since when is being a soccer commentator mean you're a professional journalist? #qanda
i mean this is getting into pretty heavy stuff #qanda
Many consider the atomic bombs dropped on Japan terrorist attacks, that opinion has been out there for many years. #QandA
The bombs shortened the war. That is not a crime #QandA
#qanda logic; let Japan invade the world in WW2
I think I should write a blog post about this. #qanda
We condemn the japanese for their behaviour but I've heard from reputable sources of hideous crimes Aussie diggers performed in WWII. #QandA
Terrorism is a subjective term. #qanda
I can't help but wonder what Ned Kelly would think of this conversation. When he wasn't busy robbing banks and killing policemen. #qanda
Anzac Day honours our war dead. Would McIntyre suggest we not do that because there were, as in all wars, war crimes committed? #qanda
#qanda panel having problems telling the truth about atomic bombs in Japan
#qanda Bombing of Dresden?
Nagasaki was bombed after Japan had sued for peace &amp; was a message to USSR #qanda #warcrimes
#QandA
We have to accept that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were war crimes, and someone needs to take responsibility. #qanda
The je suis charlie movement that ended in lives lost is far cry from the ANZAC tweets that lost a man his job... #qanda
We do not talk about war very well. At all. #QandA
Not free speech but rather expensive speech #qanda
Australia has a long &amp; proud history of aiding/abetting war crimes #qanda
all for freedom of speech but there's a difference between having opinions and using words to attack a particular group of people. #qanda
Whether you agree or disagree, access to alternate narratives and information is essential to functioning democracy. #qanda
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were civilian targets, not military ones. #QandA
#ScottMcIntyre = idiot. Highly offensive comments, highly public forum. Refused to remove tweets, breached work code. Rightly fired. #QandA
Atomic bombs dropped in Japan were terrorist acts #qanda
One nation's atomic war is another nation's terrorism.  #qanda
McIntyre implied Australia had an involvement in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That is just plain wrong. #qanda
@Wendy_Bacon @QandA Correct!
Of course Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 'terrorist attacks'. They fit the definition perfectly. #QandA
Should we be spending $100 million dollars on a war museum in France? #qanda @QandA
#QandA We need education to teach us how to ask questions - not muzzling.
As a sports journo I question whether comments on military behaviour, war crimes, accusations of rape and violence were in his PD. #qanda
World wars are terrorism on a grand scale #QandA
#qanda Nagasaki and Hiroshima were horrific events and I pray that they will never be repeated.
Freedom of speech comes with a moral responsibility #qanda @QandA
#qanda Let's not forget that the US and its allies could have blockaded Japan - more ships and materiel than the Normandy invasion
"He gives fuel to right-wing critics of SBS" So apparently the left have to just shut up? #QandA #auspol
The thrust of Scott McIntyre's tweets is him railing against the commodification, sweetening and sanitizing of the ugliness of war.  #qanda
Freedom of speech includes stupidity of speech, inaccuracy of speech #qanda
Three strikes and your out has been discounted to one strike now- Hockey's budget emergencyinfiltrates SBS policy #qanda
But we're the goodies! #Qanda
Glorifying military sacrifice for one's country is dangerous. #QandA
To a great deal of Iraqia and Afghans WE ARE TERRORISTS. #QandA
@QandA he has certainly provoked debate and use of taxpayers resources on this panel.
#QandA SBS Broadcast far more offensive material than the comments of this one man. He should not have been sacked for expressing his views.
Move on #qanda anything else to talk about?
Not about glorifying war? Geezuz Tim. The whole past month on TV has been glorifying the war and Anzac role. Wake up old man #qanda
On the other hand, footy commentators on commercial channels are able to be embarrassingly mysoginistic on national TV . . . #QandA
Shutting down free speech starts with taking peoples jobs for expressing opinions you dont agree with #qanda
Come on this guy is the new Charlie Sheen on twitter #winning #tigerblood #qanda
@JL_Whitaker @QandA It is a question we will never get an answer too.
"Terrorism" could be defined as depriving people of their homelands because they're "not viable" #qanda
What that lady has just said was an outrageous comment. It is true that Japan ww2 were war crimes to the highest level committed #QandA
@jofmcmanus @QandA why is it not live on 24?  Bit wrong I reckon
The road to the 'glorification of war' is a continuum, as unrelated tweets on Saturday show. #qanda
Were you even there, bro? #QandA
Then what do you call dropping an atomic bomb on a city of elderly, women and children? #qanda
Stuart McIntyre's comments were inappopriate, but other commentators seem to attack people or groups they don't like with impunity. #qanda
I sat opposite Tim Fisher on the VLine once. He is a man who really likes trains. #qanda
Is speech really free when you pay for it with your job? #qanda
@Kangaroo_Court @QandA @NSWSupCt The old taken out of context argument. You dumb fuck, no jurisdiction in Aust has the fuck'n death penalty.
Hey Tony should I have another drink? #qanda
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were war crimes. Whoa. #qanda
#QandA no context justifies an atomic bomb
The first and primary test of speech is whether it would cause harm to others. If so, speech is not "free", it is unwholesome. #qanda
@QandA #qanda If #alanjones or Ray Hadley can speak out &amp; give controversial opinions so can #ScottMcIntyre
#qanda Move on sick of this stupid mans tweets
#qanda   IT WAS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE STATEMENT WAS MADE...  VALID DISCUSSION STARTER BUT WRONG TONE
@QandA Agreed Tom.
Since when is the wholesale slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians considered terrorism ..? #qanda
#QandA remember we are free because of those two bombs
Not sure how we can justify the atomic bombing being done?  #qanda
#qanda @qanda I guess Arthur and Tim think Gallipoli was a good idea considering we followed US to Iraq...
#qanda @qanda Please discuss the TPP tonight. Don't put it off again Tony.
@QandA
Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from the consequences of your speech #QandA
#qanda he was a sports commentator, I disagree he should have used his SBS identity to opine. He wasn't speaking on behalf of his employer.
#qanda it is the very fact that the Anzacs fought that idiots have the freedom to make gross and inaccurate statements. #irony
Tom in a 'total war situation are there really any civilians? #qanda
It gives fuel to jihadists! Oh sweet mercy. #qanda
This woman is an idiot. Japan had already lost the war when the bombings happened. #qanda
Was it a terrorist act for AU to invade Iraq? If not it increased terror #QandA
If u tell me, those Anzac dawn services are just BS - just like memorial day is in America. You're making ppl war-death lovers #qanda
Could it be that McIntyre had just a few too many beers while playing two-up and he shot his mouth off? #qanda
Surely someone was sacked for Fresh in our Memories #qanda
Tom Porteous is a voice of complete reason. #qanda
Nagasaki was unnecessary. Japan was surrendering due to Russian involvement and threats to the emperor #qanda
This panel is so uninformed. Wow. #qanda
I wonder what would have happened if everyone just ignored Scott's tweets? #qanda
Listen to how sanctimonious we are about our own history #qanda
He never pretended to speak on behalf of his employer. An employment agreement that makes personal comments sackable office is wrong #qanda
#notetoself Dixie chicks revisited  #qanda
why weren't the atomic bombs terrorist attacks? are they offensive because some people don't want to admit they could be criminals? #qanda
When in doubt, terrorist it out #QandA
I have an opinion but I'm too scared to tweet it. #qanda
#qanda Wow, she just justified  the bombing of Japan. You should be sacked.
Did you hear that everyone? Scott McIntyre now causes terrorism, no wonder he got fired from SBS #qanda #auspol
The only reason #qanda exists is because of those men and women so many of you detest.
Seems to me a clash of generations, with the emergence of new technologies... #qanda
History is written by the victors, this does not mean that they should not be held to account. #qanda
#qanda I hate everybody who do not think the way I do
Nuking Japan was not needed and should be treated as war crimes and terrorism!!! #qanda
The prior fire bombing killed more people than the atomic bomb. #qanda
How can those bombs on Japan not be described as terrorist attacks, far exceeding 911. Tell me what's the difference between them. #qanda
How cavalier we are about the deaths of others smug bastards #qanda
#qanda should be screened instead of #aca9 - talk about meaningful discussion.
@QandA bullshit
I feel a "death cult" uttering coming on. #qanda
No. You can't avoid the fact that the second bombing too place in the context of the consequences of the first. #QandA
People need to read up on their Modern History... #QandA
War is a disgusting thing - the fact we base our nationalism based on war requires a healthy eye on jingoism #qanda
If we are not able to have a proper debate about events of the past we will continue to make the same mistakes #qanda
#qanda war crimes? Isn't that an oxymoron ?
Tom Porteous is the only sensible person on the panel #qanda
#qanda terrorism and world crimes are the same thing woman!!
NoJingoismNoJob is that the new rule? #qanda
Right at the end #qanda O_o
Lots of video questions tonight! #QandA
So now we're speculating that the US was "testing" a weapon on civilians as a result of and indescression on Twitter?  #qanda
The bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshoma were war crimes and state-sanctioned terrorism. #qanda
history is written by the victors - George Orwell #qanda
Gallipoli was an invasion of another country.  Nothing to be proud of.  @QandA #qanda
Hmmm yes these were war crimes I say 70 years after the fact sitting here in this warm studio #qanda
#McIntyre did speak freely albeit shamefully and he has now faced the consequences for it. #qanda
"Terrorism is an extremely subjective word. But (Japan bombings) were war crimes" @tomporteous #qanda @qanda http://t.co/nzbeUWCnQc
'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it' #qanda
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not terrorist attacks because they were committed by State actors. Simple definition. #qanda
The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are often and accurately described as war crimes. #qanda
Freedom of speech doesn't equate to freedom from the consequences of stupidity... #qanda
Western people get uncomfortable when the notion that terrorists aren't always Middle eastern comes up #whiteterrorism #qanda
But clearly you can draw a straight line over twitter opinions #QandA
Sorry, but as Robert McNamara said, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were by any measure war crimes and terrorism #qanda
How is ISIS vs everyone else not a world war? Because the power of the opposition is not a government? #qanda
Rest assured that our reasons are always morally pure. Our #ANZAC martyrs don't get virgins in heaven, just never grow old #qanda
The only speech that should be outlawed is support of #ISIS, terrorism and sharia law in Australia. #qanda #auapol
WWII attacks on Japan truly have nothing to do with Jihad? The beauty of history is it allows an element of hindsight.  #qanda
@QandA God I'm bored with this now. #qanda
Stop justifying dropping nukes. #qanda
Offended that dropping atomic bombs on civilians is not an act of terrorism? What if Iran did it? #qanda
He means Call of Duty. #qanda
The glorification of warfare needs to end. War isn't a good thing. #qanda
The killing of thousands of civilians with the atom bombs of WWII is never justifiable and was, indeed, a terrorist attack #qanda
I'm all for freedom of speech, but as a public figure you have to be extra careful with the words you use #ujcomm2657 #qanda
VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES #drink #qanda
It's great to know a corrupt politician can pass moral judgement over a guy expressing his views. #qanda #freshinourmemories
270, 000 is not tens of thousands #QandA
With no reference to Scott McIntyre, social media is the BEST way for conversation &amp; democracy to thrive #qanda
Absolutely Hiroshima and Nagasaki were war crimes #QandA
This female on #qanda is a totally fucken idiot.
@qanda #qanda sportscaster opines about geopolitics - sacked, Andrew Bolt makes up lies - makes money...
Out of all the things out there is the world, it is definitely not twitter which creates terrorists out of young people #qanda
#qanda the war had ended before the A bomb was dropped - she doesn't know her facts
Of course you can draw a line -- human shields, for one. Civilians, people. #qanda
"Not too much commercialisation"  Mr Fischer? How much did the federal government spend promoting Anzac Day?  #qanda
The people killed in Hiroshima would not care whether it was an act of terrorism or a 'just' act of war, they are still dead  #qanda
By talking about this at such great length, we are giving him notaries! STOP #qanda
I am watching #qanda. Should know better I know. Terrible panel is all that's wrong with #auspol, whereas some audience questions give hope
McIntyre wasn't sacked for his opinions. Wasn't sacked as a challenge of freedom of speech. Sacked because he breached work rules. #QandA
#QANDA Carolyn believe that Scott McIntyre's tweets will incite Jihadism and that's okay and no one picks her up on it? Double standard
Japan hadn't surrendered - the war was still on. The second bomb changed their mind. It was necessary. #QandA @QandA
Irony #1: freedom of speech inherently constitutes the right of listeners to freely object #worksbothways #QandA
#qanda Trouble with citizen journalism - no training.
Can I please have one million dollars? #qanda
Lel japan was proving difficult to defeat so we jus bombed all the children #qanda
I kicked my toe today and it fucking hurt like a motherfucker.  #QandA
What is terrorism? Indiscriminately killing civilians from a distance for no military purpose? Sounds like WW2 nukes to me! #qanda
I think #ScottMcIntyre got himself kicked off #TeamAustralia  #qanda
#qanda @TonyJones_qanda  Free speech and no job. Exactly. We have to be able to speak up and not lose our employment.
How is bombing, injuring and condemning ppl to long-term pain and suffering NOT a kind of terrorism? #qanda
#Qanda The PKK are a subscribed organization in Australia fighting against ISIS - are they terrorist?
#QandA All bombing of civilians is by definition terrorism. That's where the word came from, it was only attached to non-state actors later.
The bombs were unnecessary. Russia had entered the Pacific conflict and Japan was lost. There's some actual history for you. #qanda
And with that question, turn it offfffff #qanda
#qanda the lives of millions were spared by the dropping of the atomic bombs by forcing surrender rather than the invasion of japan.
Since when in Australia has being known as "a boozer and gambler" been considered an insult? #Qanda
You can certainly draw a 'crooked' line between what the US did in Japan and terrorism #qanda
Why is #qanda still dancing around the question of our attitude towards Anzac Day? Still no-one's willing to challenge it.
@QandA @fehowarth @PeterDutton_MP Commonsense prevails.
War is something to be avoided. It is not something to be proud of. #qanda
So, it would seem that eloquence is a prerequisite for expressing your opinion. Otherwise, expect to be pilloried. #qanda

Newscorp 'journos' slander and write offensive articles every day of the week  #qanda
War porn #qanda @GreydonSquare
I agree, following America's example of burning civilians alive in Tokyo will make you view ISIS favourably. Their body count is less #qanda
SHE SERIOUSLY COMPARED HIS COMMENTS TO ISIS MESSAGES? WHO THE HELL IS THIS IDIOT? SHE should be  sacked #qanda
#QandA  "I may not agree with what you say but I defend to the death your right to say it"

#QandA get your kids off video games and get them outside playing sport
Young boys need to be raised with a good set of values #qanda
Don't shock jocks and columnists make comments daily that offend a significant section of the community? #qanda
I used 2 go 2 church when younger. I attended 1st time this ANZAC day. It was a liturgy for the dead. It's now a national religion. #qanda
Oh shit here we go #qanda
VIDEO GAMES. I'M IN. #qanda
#qanda Twitter Editors. Your Pollitics are showing
#QandA I see you have at least one member of #TeamHumanity on the panel who is prepared to tell the truth about a Bloody Cruel War
The atomic bombs dropped on Japan helped end the war and hence saved thousands of lives. Sadly people die in war #qanda
Theme tonight - What is democracy? Fairness, tolerance, equity and justice #TeamTanya #qanda @QandA
Did she just try to justify the killing of thousands of innocent people. Really? Did I just hear that? #qanda
WTF???? : Iranians on Indonesia's death row have sentences commuted to life in prison #qanda #chansukumaran #bali9 http://t.co/3Xt0eqUenq
A myth is something that didn't happen, and a legend is something that did happen and was later exaggerated. #QandA
How easy it is to judge from the comfort of our armchairs so far removed from a war #qanda
#ScottMcIntyre Twitter is not a place to make complex arguments, especially ones that he knew would be against his employers policy. #qanda
Only the enemy commit war crimes #QandA
Free-speech Aussie-style: we should take pride that the SBS journo is not in jail. @QandA
The US is the only nation to be declared a terrorits state by the world court #qanda
@jofmcmanus @QandA Can listen on ABC News Radio too, which has the benefit of not having to watch the panellists!
Why are you buying your 13 year old violent video games if you don't like them? #qanda
What's with the Anti-ANZAC stuff? Fine, be anti-war.  But remember its thx to ANZACs you have the right to freedom of speech. #QandA
Ohhh right #qanda is on, later suckers *logs off*
Oh FFS. Are we so fragile we can't handle idea that Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki were "terrorism"? There's no universal defn of terrorism! #qanda
War shouldn't be glorified. We can respect their sacrifice but not glorify the idea #qanda
What about journalists that, as it suits, systematically take aim at teachers, nurses, police etc. &amp; sensationalise to sell papers? #qanda
@Any1ButTony @QandA Alan Jones' employer supports Alan's views this is the difference
They don't make them like Tim anymore. #qanda
Good question #ujcomm2657 #qanda
War should be commemorated, yes. But it should never be celebrated. #qanda
#qanda depends on what side your one how it looks. What would Japan say about the killing of its civilians.
Has anyone ever asked the kids themselves? #QandA
Does this guy work at SBS  #qanda
Aus doesnt have anything else to celebrate apart from mass genocide of its natives on the 26th, so boozing it is our next best thing #qanda
If you have a problem with violent ganes, don't let your kids play them #qanda
#QandA  it's called grooming
@maybemick yes I thought the same.. Can't believe she wasn't challenged on that comment #qanda
Unfortunately, any of us employed by a company are bound not to damage the brand. This limits freedom of speech. #qanda
People from the middle east are not the only terrorists you racist. #qanda
Australia was directly threatened in exactly one war: WWII. In all other wars, Aussies were the invaders. #ANZAC #QandA
I've heard a lot of comments about #ScottMcintyre but to suggest his tweets will create jihadists in Australia. #GoodGrief #qanda
BREAKING NEWS: NPR announce that @tanya_plibersek to replace Sarah Koenig as the host for the second season of Serial #qanda #dulcettones
Free speech comes with responsibilities which the SBS journalists broke. #qanda @QandA
THE VIDEO GAMES MADE ME DO IT ERGH ERGH ERGH #QandA
No matter how you look at it, Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war crime. Regardless of intent #qanda
Violence &amp; a sexualised society will undo our young #qanda
More people need to watch or read statements/opinions by the 'Last Anzacs' such as Ted Matthews. #qanda @QandA
"Japan was hard to defeat" - oh, so we should kill 200k innocents. makes sense #qanda
Do if an enemy is had to defeat in war it's ok to use unconventional means? Saddam Hussien could have used that defense  #qanda
So Sinodinos thinks harmony is unquestioned homogeny? #qanda
Aaahhh....digital brain farts... #qanda
I sat opposite Tim Fischer on the VLine once. He is a man who really likes trains. #qanda
There is "political spin", &amp; then there is pathological lying. I think Aus Politics has crossed that line. http://t.co/npiFYD5HgG  #qanda
History is written by the victor #QandA
Is Bomber keen to coach again? #qanda
WWII attacks on Japan truly have nothing to do with Islamic extremism. The beauty of history is it allows an element of hindsight.  #qanda
brilliant question #qanda
Minimal corruption! LOL #qanda
#qanda if you think ANZAC day is about glorifying war then you aren't paying attention
#QandA Holbrook is perpetuating the myth of the atom bombs. Obviously a state tool. Even brings in the IS terrorist narrative.
ah, i see... "terrorism" is now reserved for muslims and arabs #qanda
Why are these people so surprised about alcohol consumption and sexual assault by the Anzacs? Read some history #qanda
#QandA  Could we have a Peace Day that is celebrated in the country
Yes, blame it on COD and GTA. It is that simple. #QandA #ujcomm2657
SHOCKING. Westerner labels Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs as war crimes. Hesitant applause by audience #qanda
@Hedske13 #qanda
Lest we forget the permanent memory of the Internet. Don't destroy a person completely, allow some room for forgiveness #qanda
Stop participating in war #QandA
Re freedom of speech: the question is would Scott McIntyre's notion have been acceptable if it had been phrased in a measured tone? #qanda
Lest we forget what happened this Anzac next year. #qanda
What a brilliant question! #qanda
Oh ffs video games and film violence. Sheesh, welcome to 20 years ago. @QandA #QandA
A-bombs were not dropped on military targets at Hiroshima or Nagasaki. The man on the panel correctly calls them war crimes! @QandA #qanda
No freedom of speech in Australia this proves it. #QandA
Since when did freedom of speech mean losing your job? #qanda #ujcomm2657
Watching #qanda and reading the related tweets are a big reason why the human race disgusts me.
War crimes? War IS a crime! #qanda
Otherwise a land invasion of Japan to unconditional surrender? Yeah good luck with that #bushido #qanda
Tim brought his book of ANZAC quotes with him?  #QandA
@TrackSAFE: TrackSAFE Patron, Tim Fischer, making some very wise statements on #qanda tonight.
Do we now call our enemies terrorists so we can justify attacking civilians? #qanda
Arfur is Assistant Treasurer again.  When did that happen?  #qanda
@lolroy qanda tweets are the WORST.
Violent video games are art. Don't single them out. Violent films and books exist as well. #qanda
Now that is a much better way to question the glorification of war.  #QandA
does tim fischer th-front.. #qanda
@QandA @TurnbullMalcolm ask urselves do aussies really care about anzacs?? No..other than a day off work and drink up for the nation!!
Loving Tom Porteous :) #qanda
The nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are war crimes, as was the phosphorus bombings of Tokyo and Dresden. #QandA
McIntyre breached contract yes. But Turnbull's hand in this oversteps his role as Minister in a way that is anti-democratic. #qanda
@riotersbloc Should be watching #qanda They were discussing Mars pods? What on earth are they? (Know about the rest) Too much starch madame
Did Tim take some uppers before the show? #qanda
Here's an idea Dad, don't buy your kids video games. #qanda
My grandfather had sex with the Papua natives when he was in war. It was consensual. #qanda
Vast bulk of people who play realistic war games sensibly never want to be soldiers. #qanda
https://t.co/sTC6owjh4G Regardless of how one feels about #ScottMacintyre, there is a double standard which isn't acceptable #qanda
The killing of thousands of civilians with the atom bombs of WWII was never justifiable and was, indeed, a terrorist attack #qanda
Video games DO NOT negatively affect children's development. There are many peer-reviewed papers that prove this! #QandA #AusPol @QandA
Tim fisher is an angry ant #QandA
Let kids be kids. My brother and partner play warfare games all the time and they turned out ok? #QandA  @QandA
Killing 130,000 innocent Japanese citizens on one day in 1945 is acceptable? This is a warped perspective. #qanda
my question is for the panel: how do some men smell so good all the time? how do they do that? #qanda
Japan was on their knees, it was a war crime, do not justify that ! #qanda
Civilian deaths and rapes in war don't matter unless they are white civilians hey? #qanda
so it's not terrorism because muslim people did not execute the bombs in japan ?! someone please shut Carolyn up. #qanda @qanda
#QandA free speech isn't free.
Many parents would be horrified if they knew what their kids were getting up to on computer games. #qanda

Ok great, internet is down. #qanda is over before i really got dumb and angry, my brand is #cooked
#qanda Might be hard to believe but even 13 year olds can tell the difference between a game and real life
#QandA good parenting perhaps?
@qanda ANZAC is really something personal for the veterans themselves. We have taken it too far.
#qanda More people died in firestorm bombings of Tokyo and other Japanese cities than in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki.
How long do we keep remembering? 1000 years? Where does it end. #qanda
To what use is freedom of speech if there are restrictions as to what people can/cannot say? #qanda
Stop comparing video games to real life. Millions of people play war video games with no intention of real life warfare #qanda
Difficult to defeat in a war so lets just kill a mass of civilians ? Not then, not now and not in the future please #QandA #Hiroshima
If only there was only Anzacs around to educate us about war...or if people read. #qanda
#qanda War... what is it good for?
@QandA was at the heart of mcintyre's tweets the question: do we glorify Anzac Day now?
Ever heard of Okinawa you moron. Thousands killed for small gain. Mainland Japan would have lost millions without the bomb. #qanda
Our local dawn service focused on the "mateship" of our diggers, rather than the actual war itself, was very powerful! #QandA
Blah blah blah video games are the devil yes yes we get it #qanda
When US does it, it's part if war, when others do it - terrorism! #doublestandards #qanda
If dropping atomic bombs on Japan was ok because it was a war then Assad chemical bombing civilians is fine too? #qanda
Was shocked and alittle disturbed on how many people said "Happy Anzac Day" to me on Anzac Day. Lest We Forget #qanda
How is violence more widely accepted than love and intimacy with another human being? #qanda
Tim Fischer deftly gets a plug in for this book. #qanda
Don't blame the entertainment industry, don't like it, don't buy it #qanda
So, if it's a state that terrorizes a country, then it's not terrorism, Beg to differ! #qanda
Stop buying your kids violent video games, that's how #qanda
@QandA ANZAC day is all about glorifying war #QandA
And there is an argument that Japan would have surrendered without atomic bombs. Not proven. #qanda  https://t.co/BEeHNMfEP4
Ok. They weren't terrorism. They were war crimes. So much better. Sheesh! #qanda #FragilePetals
These ANZAC questions are doing my head in. Heavy like a craniotomy. #qanda
ANZAC Day is glorified by wannabes and neverweres. #qanda
this Carolyne woman has a brain around the size than a beef ant's brain #qanda #auspol
Sorry, but that woman on the #qanda panel is a moron. Millions have died in the Middle East thanks to US terrorism.
Modern warfare:we promote it in video games, celebrate Anzac Day with carnivalesque behaviour...glorifying much? #qanda
#qanda If there were no soldiers there would be no wars
Can only younger generations handle social media? #qanda
the struggle for the state of Israel began with a bombing of a public hotel. #qanda
Omg your a parent thats your job.you filter your own kids . Its your decision . #qanda
What a conundrum. Great question #QandA #ujcomm2657
I heard nothing on Anzac Day that in any way glorified war. #QandA
There's no question that war games make it OK for kids war #qanda
@Wendy_Bacon @Reidyfour @QandA shame @mcintinhos is a great football commentator, however I think he had an offensive tone in his tweet.
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were war crimes and, like terrorists, instrumentally killed civilians for political ends #QandA
So does everything that the disgusting Andrew Bolt says represent the views of Channel 10 or the Herald Sun? Hypocrisy.  #QandA
Defence recruiters are now at football games. My grandfather didn't fight for that. #qanda
Friendly reminder there is no causation between video game violence and violent behaviour #qanda
We NEVER glorify war, we commemorate those who faced the atrocities for their country!!! #qanda
@qanda #qanda have more faith that you've raised your children well enough to tell the difference between reality and computer games
.@SigmundMarx thinks there is a right way for journalists to start public debates #QandA http://t.co/PE3LuI9i3n
#qanda Young people need to know the real war story: many generations of suffering @qanda
ive read some persuassive books making the argument that ataomic bombings by aqmerica were an afterthought. the war was already won #qanda
#qanda is not a place for deep questions. Move along now.
This isn't a new debate: http://t.co/3Kq2utlS6B #qanda

There appears to be a wisdom that only comes after the experience of war, rarely before. #QandA
Couldn't #qanda get any of its first choice panelists tonight?
describing hiroshima as a terrorist act promotes jihadist behaviour? what planet is holbrook commentating from? #qanda

ANZAC an act of propaganda and consummate spin; spinning a tragedy into national legend. #qanda
War should always be questioned. #qanda
I for 1 don't want to remember our Diggers as sexist pigs as well. There are a lot of tasteless tweets #qanda #auspol http://t.co/zXpOd1BP5r
#qanda at our heart we are a peaceful country, no violence in our language or actions
Well quoting from a book must make it all true Tim Fischer #qanda
I'm sure if you asked jihadis if they think they're operating within a global war they'd say yes. History is written by the winners #qanda
#QandA Australia has had so few wars and talks about it way too much
Thanks to the ANZACs for our Freedom #qanda
Tim's on fire tonight #qanda

How can you say that platitudes such as mateship, courage, sacrifice, to define the Gallipoli disaster isn't glorification of war #qanda ?

#qanda Educating the youth about war isn't glorifying it, if done properly peace will reign forever @QandA

How many million Chinese died under Japanese occupation? Oh never mind, not all at once. #qanda
Holbrook the historian is hopeless. #qanda
ANZAC day highlights the horrors of war. Who is glorifying war? #QandA
Soldiers don't glorify war, but the MSM sure gives it a boost #qanda
Anyone who thinks that Anzac Day glorifies war has never commemorated one. #qanda

Anzac day is the perfect day for us to consider Scott McIntyre's comments #qanda
The bombing of Japan certainly killed many, many civilians. But in all likelihood shortening the war saved more. #qanda
#qanda Can we agree Andrew Bolt's isn't entitled to freedom of speech as a journalist, and an SBS jorno is?
@QandA Good on Fischer. I like to see someone well read make a good point.
#ANZAC not glorifying war. Just glory of glorious death as glorious sacrifice immortalised in unwearied glory for glorious eternity #qanda

Great, more of the video games = violent children discussion..... *rolls eyes. Let's talk about bad parenting. #qanda
Not the video games cause children to grow up as murderers chestnut again! Move on from this topic already! #QandA
@QandA Free West Papua ! #QandA
#qanda video game violence again? How about we focus on the sexist portrayal of women in video games. That has much more effect on children.
I honour our sacrificed Anzacs, but not those who for political ends wrap themselves in the flag falsely claiming to commemorate them #qanda
I play Assassin's Creed. I love playing it. It doesn't mean I have any pull to suddenly assassinate the pope. #qanda

#QandA I grew up on the early 50s playing war, without a video game in sight.
@JaneCaro Unless it's a racist tweet or comment or pic on social media. Because minorities' feelings don't matter much in Australia #qanda

If you can't stop your kids form playing violent video games it is your fault not society's. #qanda
If you have a problem with violent games, don't let your kids play them #qanda

#qanda violence sells
Why is Tim Fisher yelling all the time? #qanda
@QandA isn't anything Arthur says tainted given his memory issues identified in Sydneywater gate.  $20m pocketed was it?
@Wendy_Bacon @QandA precisely Wendy. It's a panicked overreaction to political pressure and preciousness about national myths.
Violent video games have no link to violence. Militarism just might. #qanda
Every Anzac Day speech I heard spoke of hating war, NOT how wonderful it was #QandA
I swear if I hear one more ignorant, dumb pleb say violent Video Games are a Negative Influence I'm going to... I don't even know. #Qanda

#qanda stop sending our men to others WAR!

"10s of 1000s of civillians died" indiscriminate killing of innocent people,to some necessary, others terrorism  #nagasaki #hiroshima #qanda

Pretty sure you shouldn't compare ANZACs to the Iraq war... That. Is highly offensive #QandA
Seriously? @newscomauHQ is live tweeting this episode of #QandA haha.
Australia needs to find a narrative not based on Jingoism - but we do because we cannot argue with the dead #qanda
Turn on the 6 o'clock news &amp; you'll see &amp; hear about plenty of violence #qanda
Incinerating civilians with nuclear weapons is fucking madness. Typical some Australians would attempt to justify it #qanda
War Crimes!? There's revisionist history of a time that the ICC and international law were very different or non-existent. #qanda
I have the utmost respect for the ANZAC's but the romanticisation/glorification of war makes me sick. #ujcomm2657 #qanda

Sir John Monash wasn't following the narrative. Dig him up &amp; sack him. #qanda
In the words of Paul Keating: war was an inexcusable folly #qanda @qanda
War is ugly, some seem to be celebrating days like Anzac Day now, very different to when I was a teen in the 1980's! #qanda
Hiroshima and Nagasaki where to terrorise Japan into surrendering were they not terrorised? #qanda
Random quote from Fischer......what was the question again? #qanda
I didn't realise John Monash was 'deaf' I have more respect for him now. #qanda
Don't let them play video games with weapons ... you're the parent it's your responsibility #qanda
Not about glorification of war but glorifying the people who committed the acts?  #qanda
So indiscriminate acts of killing is perfectly just in the context of War No it's a War Crime #qanda
What is this man saying? All due respect but can't make head nor tail of his point. Time for a cuppa #qanda

I hope #QandA discuss the real topics. Can we please talk about Ed Balls Day now.

What a well-worded and well-rounded question #qanda Very good valid observations sir! #auspol #glorificationofWAR #ANZAC
Frequently this 'exposure to violence equals violent people' nonsense has been debunked #QandA
As Edwin Starr sang "War, What is good for. Absolutely nothin'!" #qanda
You'd have to be a bit simple to think that Anzac is a glorification of war. #QandA
All those who think war is ok can go to the next one esp Mr Fisher #qanda
Its sad that were more angry about our values being challenged rather than our nations values that are carrying out humanrights abuse #qanda
#qanda War is sometimes necessary, but it is never moral.
The Anzacs were socialised into going to war. Why do we do the same to boys today? #qanda
There is no glory in war - we glorify their sacrifice and what they were fighting for #qanda
#qanda #glorification and #reflection of war should not get confused.
#QandA All the heavy shooting games are rated MA 15+ if your oldest kid is 13 he shouldn't be playing!
#QandA  As our veterans who marched and really knew about the war die off ANZAC has become more shrill
So long as mankind is setting foot upon this earth, there will always be war #qanda
Needlessly bombing Japanese civillians is a war crime and terrorist act imo #qanda

How is violence and war glorified to be more widely accepted than love and intimacy with another human being? #qanda
This #PS4NPLVIC  game is getting very ho hum with Victory up 7-0. First time I'm actually interested in #qanda tweets.
#QandA the defence forces advertised for recruits during the ANZAC day activities!!!!  It's cool for kids ?

#qanda - remember the sacrifices so they are not repeated. By honoring the sacrifices you glorify &amp; glamorize wars

#QandA @QandA Is it just me, or is Islamic State the only one glorifying war, even celebrating it?

Militarisation is not confined to physical wars - just look at the racist politics around immigration and nationhood. It's perverse. #QandA
#QandA Tim come back Parliment
Can we celebrate the white male anymore than on ANZAC day? #qanda
'Lest we repeat' #qanda
.@Wendy_Bacon @QandA for @ChrisCourtney4 - people having their fantasies - or true beliefs - kicked in the arse doesn't negate free speech
I've met a few soldiers. None I have met glorify their experience. It is their job. The people who send them to war, however... #qanda
#qanda Tim you are a legend
Could our treatment of each refugees be terrorism on them??? @QandA  #qanda
@FreeWestPapua #qanda @QandA Over 500,000 murdered by Indonesia - still going on. Why does this never reach mainstream discussion
Great question. As journalists we should be asking tough questions to get conversation going. But we also have to be accurate! #qanda
How do I stop flyaway hair #qanda
And what was the duty to our country in 1914-19? @QandA
A generation that has never experienced war, cannot understand the sacrifices that our forefathers made. Why is it celebrated #qanda @QandA
Soldiers never glorify war. The people who send them there do. #qanda
[sick rock music playing on the australian defence force ads] #qanda
I think we always say Gallipoli was horrible, that's the resounding message I always get. I don't think we use it to glorify war #qanda

Anzac Day doesn't glorify war. It's there to show respect for those who lost their lives for Australia. #ujcomm2657 #qanda
War is terrible and a failure of diplomacy.  Heroes who gave their lives for Australia are just that.  Easy distinction.  #qanda
Want kids to appreciate war properly in games? One game = one life. No restarts. #qanda
So is National Security important to everyone? #QandA
Oz's job used to be to save refugees. Now it is Oz's job to push them back. Attitudes change. I want the old ones back #qanda
It's not hard to keep your kids away from violent video games and movies! That's why you have ratings. Be a parent. #QandA
Amazing panel tonight, brilliant questions as well !!! #QandA
We don't glorify our military enough #qanda
Why add between the lines? Anzac commemorations DO NOT glorify war. #qanda
I support the troops... Not the actions they are ORDERED to commit. #qanda
If you have made a choice to kill for a nation, that is a wrong choice. #qanda
We are all programed to be warriors, as a parent the best thing i can do for may son is make sure that his is an an honorable warrior #qanda
Is this the ultimate lefty love in #qanda Tim Fischer stand up #theultimatestatesmen
I see #QandA is its usual #quality according to my twitter feed. #yawn
Ari Gold : Hug it out... bitch #QandA
@QandA The pentagon has spent Billions helping design computer War Games - helps the recruitment drive!!
#QandA mature nations do not get defensive or punish people who dare to express views different from mainstream ones
#qanda was Tim pre-warned of that question #? A Dorothy Dixer.
Tim Fischer speaks so eloquently and passionately about the ANZAC spirit #ujcomm2657 #qanda
The allied bombing of many European cities during WWII may also be seen as crimes of war in war. #qanda
#AnzacDay IS about the glorification of war. The memorial to those fallen has been lost completely to political gain. #qanda
Everyone is in furious agreement that war is bad. #qanda
#QandA stop referring to "theatres of war"
I'm yet to hear a convincing argument that the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were anything other than 'terrorism'. #qanda
@QandA #QandA Here's a "LIVE" Twitter Question for you.  Why can I not watch QandA "LIVE" in South Australia?  What's wrong with you?
Which News Ltd papaer does this woman write for? #Qanda
Perhaps these violent video games which seem to glorify war need to be more tightly restricted. #QandA
#JesuitMcintyre? #qanda
#qanda headcount. 1 jingoistic old codger, 1 shameless apologist, 1 Howard-looking Howard stooge, 1 1/2 people with functioning brains
#qanda how do you honour a practitioner and not glorify the practice? How can you honour a murderer without honouring the murder?
@QandA the glorification makes the sacrifice seem worth it. Though it does need to stop.
#qanda @QandA  maybe they wouldn't have volunteered if they'd played xbox and realized the horrors ahead of them?
The actual Anzac diggers never carried on like they do today on Anzac Day. #QandA
Oh, yeah. Because westerners did it. For freedom, etc. #qanda
Thanks Tim Fischer, I didn't think I'd had enough jingoism and hyperbole this week, but you have me more. #qanda
Millions of lives are lost due to the inability of a few to reach diplomacy #qanda
The Anzac legend involves remembering the sacrifices that these young soldiers made, not glorifying their methods of warfare #qanda
Video games have ratings for a reason. #QandA
War what is it good for. #qanda @QandA
#qanda Worth remembering the work our armed forces does during natural disasters as well.
#QandA if anyone is trying to blame terrorism on the avengers you all just need to watch it again!! #howgoodisit!!!!??
Maybe we don't glorify soldiers as heroes. They're doing a dirty yet necessary job. Like plumbers, but with bullets. #qanda
Always good to get both points of view. War is pretty shit for all involved. #qanda  https://t.co/KuUmSDfPIs
Next time the Japanese Imperial Army is invading, I know who I'd want to defend Australia. And it's not the lefties.  #qanda
Calling ANZAC day "sacred" is a misuse of the word #qanda
Who is glorifying war? #qanda
ANZAC day about remembering those that made incredible sacrifices, not about war crimes or glorification #qanda
it stopped being comemeration and became a celebration... Its NOT.. its war! #auspol #qanda
Monash commanded ANZACS who became ruthless, successful killers on the Western Front #QandA #ANZACS
Our soldiers more than exemplify the ANZAC spirit. I've met many of them. I'm related to some of them. To say otherwise is an insult. #qanda
Can we see a pie chart at the end of every #qanda that shows how much time each panel member speaks?! @QandA #Tim&amp;Carolyn show! #auspol
Anybody enjoying the privileged life we have in Australia has no choice by to respect the sacrifice of the men who fought at Kokoda. #qanda

Remove the kid's remote control #qanda
Don't forget how many front-line Anzac troops voted against conscription. They knew war was hell. #qanda
Don't mention OUR dark deeds in war Keep waging terra nullus war on the homefront SOSBLAKAUSTRALIA #QandA
Young men! Don't take any notice of ISIS...joining a war in a far off place. And coming up next ANZAC Birth of a Nation! w/ ADF ads! #qanda
I feel great pride that Australia remembers a massive defeat &amp; not a military victory. Reminds us all of the futility of war. #QandA
You mean after or before "deposing" @SIartybartfast? #auspol #qanda
Since when did a soccer reporter have licence 2 stereotype diggers? Would #qanda be so quick to defend @mcintinhos if Isis was in the gun?
You have no business complaining about terrirism being used as a legitimate tactic of war if you justify those weapons being used #qanda
I don't support war but I dam well support any soldier that fights on behalf of our country #qanda
Qanda how do we glorify war and have so many homeless vets
Video games have ratings for a reason. Parents need to parent and say NO #qanda
#qanda too many commentators use the term celebration of war now. It is never a celebration.
Now have to rethink 5, 6  or more times before tweeting or RT in case someone is offended? #qanda
It should be 'lest we forget the horrors of war and those victimized by it'. #qanda
Phil - don't buy your kids the games  @QandA #QandA
@JasminaMarkulic @QandA SO true. If the pilot of the German Wings plan was Muslim, it would have been "terrorism", not a simple "depression"

My boy and I play @worldoftanks but I have to be a better father than simply allowing a game to teach him everything #QandA
#QandA Ways to serve your country also involved civic participation like holding govt to account, not just going to war.
USA &amp; China have death penalty why aren't you all commenting daily on everyone on death row? #QandA
This gov is all about the glorification of war. #qanda
@QandA #QandA When will Australia commemorate The Frontier Wars like Anzac?
The problem is almost all our wars have been for someone else. Pretending these wars were just or necessary amounts to glorification #QandA

#qanda Can we agree that Andrew Bolt isn't entitled to freedom of speech as a journalist, and an SBS jorno is? /s
Of course it's not us glorifying war - only the 'other side' does that... #qanda
#QandA They had a job to do in Iraq- so care to explain what that job was Mr Fisher, was it WMD, that did not exist?
Alot of the blame of this so called glorification of war must be put on the media, not on the diggers #QandA
Wait are we demonising video games again? Is it 1997 again? #qanda
#Qanda  Anzac spirit was about mateship, looking after each other. The RSL promotes gambling, how is that looking after fellow Australians?
War is apart of our history #QandA @QandA
@QandA There is a rating on violent video games for a reason.. the parent is in control. #qanda
As veterans we can say that there is no greater lover of peace and hater of war than the soldier. #qanda
I don't think people are saying soldiers are glorifying war, it's what other do to the day after the fact. Remember the 60's and 70's #qanda
I wonder if more women were leading countries whether there would be less wars in the world?if there was no religion maybe no war #QandA
#qanda Old school domination, colonist is embedded in every day and especially young violent war games glorified.
@AuntyNeville664  I wouldn' watch QandA its a lefty guilt session.@QandA
Remember how we went to war in Iraq to train the Iraq army, which became ISIS, which we are now training Iraq to fight against #qanda

There is more to the defence forces than war! People do not choose to enlist based on going to war #QandA
Standing on Bondi Beach for the dawn service remembering the lives of young men that were loss did not feel like glorifying war. #QandA

@QandA @TurnbullMalcolm   Who cares. He knew what he was doing. He is a journalist for gash sake!
Speaking of free speech remember how the Minister of Anzac or whatever has to approve the use of 'Anzac'? #qanda

Marilyn Lake's 'What's Wrong with ANZAC' is a good read re: Anzac debate #qanda

The sanctimonious bollocks from the panel on McIntyre is  disappointing but predictable #qanda
It's a video game it's not propaganda #ujcomm2657 #qanda

RSL?? They barely give any support to returning soldiers now, let alone in WWI #QandA
We send foreign countries our troops, they send us their refugees. #qanda
Australians should stop marking Anzac Day. #QandA
Holbrook has been excruciating #qanda
@QandA #QandA I know people with kids older than 13 that don't allow them any gaming contact that isn't supervised
Video games can be an excellent historical resource to teach the horrors of war. #qanda
Wars do not decide who's right or wrong, just who's left.. #qanda @QandA
My children are horrified by war as a result of learning about the ANZAC's #QandA
What is a freedom of speech? #pmlive #qanda
Many of the returned soldiers don t even want to talk about the War or celebrate it. They'd know. #QandA
The idea that Anzac Day was about 'victory' as suggested by PM Abbott was obscene #qanda
#qanda Australia's participation in the First Gulf War helped the rise of ISIS - when will we learn?
I trust his kids aren't watching Game of Thrones then? #qanda
So the dad is upset about his kids playing the war video games he probably bought  #qanda
@Wendy_Bacon @JoeGorman_89 @QandA he wasn't sacked on the spot. He was asked to retract the tweets and he refused. No brainer.
@QandA can we have parental guides before the news is broadcast?
Want kids to stop playing violent video games?  Put less Reality TV &amp; Sport on television! #QandA #AusPol @QandA
Hey #qanda twitter feed selector how about some balance against all the anti ANZAC bile.  @qanda.

If we are showing respect to all veterans on ANZAC Day, what about support for those returning with PTSD today? #qanda
War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength. #QandA
Worst part of #anzac day is when footy commentators compare players on the field with acts of our soldiers. #disgraceful #qanda
Anzac is just a word. Wake up and smell the ink. I want to throw up. #qanda
The issue is glorification, not commercialisation #qanda
@QandA @tomporteous very true but that's the rule for society not for the workplace!
As Edwin Starr sang "War, What is it good for. Absolutely nothin'!" #qanda
ANZAC Day doesn't glorify war, that's why we remember our greatest defeat not our victories. #qanda
@rglover702 @QandA True, let's not forget those Al Jazeera jurnos in Egypt.
@newscomauHQ @tanya_plibersek @QandA
#qanda war is war stop romanticising it that simple
Patrick Cripps was robbed of an ANZAC medal. Can you please put forward this issue to the hippies in your crowd? #qanda
War, what is it good for? Absolutely nothing #QandA
Most soldiers who survived WWI thought it was a colossal waste of life #qanda
Keep war to history lessons and away from social media and marketing. #QandA
Glorifying war is something the ISIS propaganda youtube clips have done a good job of #qanda
@MKPS001 No idea. Gremlins taking over. Have seen at least two "brilliant question" tweets on screen. #qanda
The ANZACs criticised the wars and ANZAC day but when remembering them we can't do the same? #qanda
We were the invaders. The Turks were defending their homeland. Yet the Anzacs were honourable .  Why ?  #qanda
@QandA Carolyn Holbrook would do well to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, a very sobering, remarkably frank/unbiased experience #qanda
Malcolm Turnbull is a dibber dobber #QandA
Irony: criticism of Australia's war participations by the very people who's freedoms were granted by these same war efforts on #qanda
#qanda going from the death penalty &amp; executions, free speech on twitter, ANZAC Day thoughts &amp; linking video games to war. Interesting night
There's a rating system for games. If 13 yr old is playing such games why parents are buying them #qanda
#qanda Without the atomic bombs, Japan would have kept fighting and more lives would have been lost.
Looks like Carolyn won't be selling too many of her fairytale 'book' #qanda
@QandA #qanda had to turn off after the bloody jingoism of Anzac and the justification of Hiroshima and Ngasaka, shameful orthodoxy
Anzac shouldn't be a brand #QandA
@bobothecreepycl @QandA  Like you have credibility, Bobo? Even you have no confidence in the shit you speak. Are you sober?
#qanda. Stop aid now Indonesia obviously hates us. Please use money here
Our PM's are always keen to be the ones to "inform" the public of operational matters. Leave it to the ADF HEADS #QandA
We should glorify our scientists and inventors and teachers at least as much. #qanda
Maybe parents could stop buying their kids violent video games and have them outside kicking the footy #QandA
#QandA We just need to look after them when they come home, just like all first responders. #safetyatwork
the politics of going to war needs to stay separate from respecting our soldiers. #QandA
##TomPorteus refreshing to hear a thoughtful and fair minded person. @qanda #qanda
All offence to grandstanding politicians. #qanda
November 11 - celebrating Peace - Much better #qanda
Tim, not to mention affording us freedom of speech. #qanda
MA ratings are there for a reason #qanda
Great Tim,  you mentioned East Timor a dirty little war that Australia turned a blind eye to for 25 years! #qanda
Anzac leaves those Australians who aren't white, straight, and male in a subordinate position on this nation's foundational plane #qanda
#qanda These smarmy hypocrites. Reza Berati was executed by Australia on Manus Island. Don't be sucked in. The govt are amoral populists.
Anzac Day is about remembering the people, not the war. #QandA
I don't see people glorifying war on #AnzacDay I see people commemorating those who fought and those who lost their lives #qanda
@QandA #qanda Doesn't Abbott's French Folly glorify war? Why on earth did he announce this? Captain's Call?
Shit Tim it's not about what a good job they did, it's about the fact they had to do the job at all #qanda
You can honour soldiers without honouring the war. #qanda
The actual Anzac Day doesn't glorify war... But the "brandzac" concept is a new low. #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Games don't kill people, people kill people.  #qanda
Because censorship of commercial products solves all the problems. Face palm. #qanda
RSL clubs have more pokies than practically anyone - so I guess it IS about gambling... #qanda
I think we are all ready to ask first and shoot later nowadays #qanda
Parents should use the ratings on the video game to decide if they want to let there child play it or not #qanda
@QandA @tomporteous Not anything. What about incitement to violence, hatred? That's ok is it? #qanda
The RSL has endorsed some commercial campaigns that have had the effect of cheapening Anzac Day. #qanda

ANZAC has been spun into a product, a celebration, a reason to party, everything but what it should be #qanda
The association of masculinity with violence and war is a method of population control #qanda
Commemoration not celebration. Respect the sacrifice. QandA giving lots of food for thought.
What is it about old LNP stalwarts that they become rational, compassionate humans once they leave politics? #qanda
@QandA #qanda Most people say that the bravery came from #ANZAC soldiers doing things they didn't want to do.

Stop commercialization of ANZAC? Is CHolbrooks serious - she wrote a book on ANZACs. donated all $ to charity? #auspoI #qanda
Words are powerful. Tony Abbott called Gallipoli a "splendid defeat". Hmmm !  #qanda
Did I miss something? All I have seen is images &amp; messages of how horrifying war is, and toll paid by many. Who is glorifying it? #qanda
I think I'm giving up on #qanda for a while.
Australia has only defended its "way of life" once. Neglecting the frontier wars is the real reprehensible neglect of fact @QandA #qanda
#qanda it was the 100 the anniversary, of course it's a big deal this year

#AnzacDay reduced to a round of football, a beer promotion and a holiday package deal. #QandA
#qanda We teach our young that the military are peacekeepers and protectprs of our way of life. They are not glorified killers.

Anzac Day is about the massive losses every community experienced, for no reason anyone ever understood. #qanda
Let's be realistic here, ask your average Australian what ANZAC Day means and they'll probably say "a day off and 2 up" #qanda

#qanda great comment - stop the politicians from using ANZAC to whip up nationalism
So true. Politicians love to wrap themselves in the flag and ANZAC is victim to this trend #QandA
We have a homophobic, misogynist prime minister.. Why can't we sack him!? #qanda
ANZAC day now has basically become an excuse to get drunk &amp; gamble #qanda
.@ChrisCourtney4 @Wendy_Bacon @QandA Scott didnt fuck up, he told the truth, and those w/power chose to crawl to bitter dolts like u
@jofmcmanus do you have a smart tv or a media player? #QandA i also available live on ABC iView.
Politicians tap into ANZAC when they need to convince the public to go to yet another war. #qanda
I will never see complete and utter tragedy as a glorified national legend.  #anzacday #qanda
How can I remember something I never experienced?  #qanda
Lets not classify ISIS as all of the "Middle East" #qanda
#qanda yes, we'll remember Anzac for "1000 years". I'd hate for another event to supplant it.
Ask some Indigenous people how they feel about Australia Day! #qanda
#QandA I'm sorry I really don't like Dr Holbrook. I hate to make snap decisions but instant dislike.
This! #qanda http://t.co/1T3dnbIC7N
People died a hundred years ago: Buy VB! #QandA #auspol #grossadvertising
Is MORE social control really the answer to ANZAC commodification (exploitation)? #qanda @QandA
Maybe we should focus on Govs who send ppl to fight &amp; die for them. Mainly b/c they wouldn't/couldn't engage in effective diplomacy #qanda
It's not about glorifying war. It's about mourning the loss of young men. #QandA
Politicians had a close relationship with ANZACs, they sent the soldiers to the slaughter #qanda
Freedumb. #QandA
Tony Abbott seems his happiest when photographed with the military! #qanda
Politics is the reason people get sent to war #qanda
I didn't realise our freedoms were threatened so deeply by the Turkish. #qanda
How did the ANZACs free Australia? - didn't they lose that war #qanda
There's no video games about bullying in schools but it still happens. #Qanda
#QandA Wasn't so long ago when Women could not march on ANZAC day-Have the RSL really changed?
So supporting ANZAC is now a trend? #QandA
Carolyn - What has ANZAC got to do with the video games? #qanda @qanda
I was just about to ask that! I've played war games for many years and it seems to me that they glorify war and make it look fun! #QandA
Why can't 'Lest We Forget' mean lest we foget the MISTAKE of war ie don't do it anymore or again? #qanda
My Father as a serviceman saw the aftermath of Hiroshima. He would support @mcintinhos tweet if he was alive today #QandA
People need to know that ANZAC was a farce @QandA #QandA
Nice dawg #qanda
Is there an increase in the militarisation of our Australian history syllabus? #qanda
No one is suggesting all Anzacs were saints. The overwhelming majority were. #qanda
There is much praise for our soldiers but why are Govts so miserable towards war veterans who desperately are in need of help? #qanda
Aren't you ashamed to have the Anzac myth as our civic religion? #qanda
The ABC needs to take a close look at its @QandA panel vetting process. There appears to be an academic making sense this evening.
I want to know where war is glorified? #qanda
How interesting that Tanya Plibersek refused to support the sacking of Scott McIntyre. #qanda
Glorified or not we owe our privilege to what ANZACs past and present sacrificed for us #QandA
@senthorun Aussie, Aussie, Aussie! Oi, what'd you say about ANZAC Day, mate? #qanda
#qanda Politicians are now using Anzac day to justify their own unjustifiable wars
That guy creates video questions while his kids are playing video games. #QandA
I bet all of those "anti ANZAC's" don't whinge about the public holiday. Respect for our heroes and what they stood for! #qanda
Also, #qanda with more than one politician on the panel are usually much more anger inducing
Politicians go hunting votes on #AnzacDay #qanda
War should be last resort to solving conflicts. War is horrid with no winners.  #qanda
man arthur's head is so shiny #qanda
As I've said before, I wish we remember how Australia was founded. Let's properly commemorate the violent colonisation of this land. #qanda
#qanda I have felt that some of the blanket coverage of the Gallipolli anniversary has shifted dangerously close to sentimentalising war.
We need to move forward and focus on the declining slaughter rates worldwide while we help billions build infrastructure #teamhuman #QandA
#qanda "thanks to the anzacs for our freedom"? When did we become the United States?
#qanda War. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing.
If we stop remembering it will happen again. Lest We Forget #qanda
terrorism - an act of terror executed BY ANYONE, not just muslim people. #qanda @qanda
Because censorship and prohibition solves all the problems. Face palm. #QandA
We need to consider there have been other sacrifices made by others which have been paramount to Australian freedom. #qanda #ujcomm2657
ANZAC day is nationalistic propaganda designed to perpetuate the pro-war atmosphere in this country @QandA
@newscomauHQ @QandA what the heck does this mean?Freedom of speech...hmmm
Politicians will jump on anything that keeps them employed #qanda #noshame #workforyourcountryhahahaha

Last year at a dawn service a stranger shook my grandfather's hand and thanked him for his service to our country. This is #anzac #qanda
maybe because there was a war going on and Australians were dying in the 60s &amp; 70s #qanda
Remembrance Day is a time for peaceful reflection. #qanda

When will my period come? #qanda
Just say no to revisionist history #ANZAC #qanda
@QandA @TurnbullMalcolm  poor youngsters who were sent to their deaths,  are Heroes of the Legend...but there is no glorification.
By publicly celebrating diverse representations of all genders, young ppl are more equipped to create their own authentic identities #qanda
I'd rather see the PM in Canberra, Australia rather than Turkey. #QandA
I prefer Remembrance Day. Remember why we went and why we never want to go back #QandA
We revere the ANZACS but forget the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. We are hypocrites #qanda
It is armament companies that are promote war,  huge industry with political ties, e.g. huge arms build up in Middle East right now. #Qanda
Requidesence? #qanda
#qanda having freedom, means having to live with the consequences of being freely  wrong or right in other peoples eyes
Perhaps we should stop remembering Anzac day, but keep the biscuits! #qanda

#qanda for g'sake Phil! Anzac is not glorification of war but an honouring those who died for our freedom! Remove branding but still honour!
#qanda Anzac Day was used as a recruitment tool by warmongers
If you take ANZAC commemorations away from parliamentary oversight we'll be holding dawn services for climate change next year! #qanda

Politicising a topic that is clearly too taboo to disagree with. #qanda

Have we actually learnt anything from the numerous wars we have been involved in? #qanda

Everything is a brand. Thats the point. #QandA
@QandA #QandA #HomeAndAway did a fitting tribute to ANZAC Day last week
Now Arfur says he remembers the '60s. LIAR! #qanda
Would a rap band called A'n'ZAC be allowed? #qanda
The problem for Australia is we don't have a narrative left &amp; right agree on for legislating nationhood #qanda monarchy? multiculturalism?
Abbott would do anything to put his face in front of a group of servicemen and a bunch of Australian flags, including on #AnzacDay #qanda
#qanda politicians only care about votes, not the reality of the ANZACs
#qanda Politicians got the troops into the mess that the troops had to make a legend about to get out of...
#BRANDZAC is so last week. Mother's Day's coming up! #Qanda
Hugo Throssell VC from Gallipoli, committed suicide, because he became a socialist, denounced war &amp; was accused of treason. #qanda

Speaking of glorifying violence, this is currently on in melbourne #qanda http://t.co/uyRQayTIo8
@JB_AU then I am sure you will deal with those consequences. Social Media shouldn't mean say anything with no consequences #qanda
Recrudescence. Now there's a word #qanda
It's the Jingoism and nationalistic  boganity that is the problem. ANZAC should not be an excuse for racism #QandA
#qanda why have Essendon and Collingwood got exclusive rights to the Anzac Day game?
@qanda Gallipoli was a massive fail as was Vietnam.  Let it rest.
Do we ban books/movie that use war as a topic for entertainment. Conflict is a part of society and used for education &amp; entertainment #qanda
Arthur Sinodinos' knot game is strong. That windsor knot is spectacular #qanda
The Murdoch family played a major role in shortening our involvement at Gallipoli. #qanda
@TISMtambourine @qanda Now there is a really good question that needs to be asked!
sinodinos grew up in the 60s. no wonder he's such a rampant hippy. #qanda
You can respect the diggers and still abhor the carnage of war #qanda
Carolyn is possibly the best panelist that has ever been on #qanda
Anzac is a religion and blasphemy is not allowed #qanda
None of us asked any of you bloodsuckers to go to Gallipoli Arthur #qanda
You can't control the commercialism of Anzac Day- every commercial TV station only want ratings and hammer any issue to acquire this #QandA
As a young person, the only ANZAC events I heard about were nightclub 'ANZAC' parties. But sure, it's not commercialised #qanda
#qanda Australia has bigger issues the ice drug epidemic ruining the people on it plus the families of the person on it. Come on people
ANZAC Day increasingly a media event #qanda
#qanda A veteran spoke at my school today of 1200 students. Touching to see the respect. Lest we forget.
Wow!  There is controversy about our history.  How wonderful for the future. .  #ANZAC #qanda
#qanda whats this journalst saying every knows carnage and pilidge and rape are part of war why be selective about ANZACS
this is some backwards 'battlers made howard' line of reasoning and he needs muting #qanda
The truth is the first casualty of war, why should ANZAC day be any different. #QandA #ujcomm2657
People who say Anzac Day glorifies war don't understanding the real meaning of the day. #qanda
How can people complain about alcohol brands with ANZAC? Rum in a coffee is an Australian tradition. Don't be a nanny state. #qanda
It's not support and interest for the ANZAC story, Arthur. It's nationalist propaganda. #qanda
Scratch the surface of any foundation myth and you will find it stinks. #qanda
#qanda there were other options besides dropping the bomb.

Recrudescence - what a word! #qanda
Seeing the sights of countless young children at dawn services and Anzac marches just show the Anzac memory wont die anytime soon #qanda
ANZAC Day should be bipartisan #qanda
Young people aren't interested from the get go. It's only after we have it shoved down our throats in school. #qanda
Can't wait until we honour the war on asylum seekers #qanda
All these people saying ANZAC day is glorifying war. What should we do on ANZAC day instead then if we are doing it wrong? #QandA
For me - I appreciate everything the ANZACs did for our freedom #qanda
Shift in community sentiment or whipped up nationalistic chauvinism that underpins neo-liberal agenda Sinodinis? #qanda
Sinodinos just used a word I didn't know. Wow #qanda
So true. Rather than lead community sentiment, politicians pander to community sentiment #qanda
What Australian freedom were the soldiers defending? Was Turkey invading Australia? No. Stop thia spin, they were defending nothing. #qanda
ANZAC Day isn't to glorify war. It's so we don't forget the horror so we learn from our mistakes and never make them again. #qanda
"We glorify values and underpin what (the Anzacs) were trying to do." Sinodinos @qanda #qanda http://t.co/SJZdU9eOj8 http://t.co/RzafYZV8ag

In remembering those who died, we must remember ALL who died. Including those we killed, maimed, and destroyed. #qanda
So when politicians daw there were votes in Anzac Day Politicians hopped on the bandwagon Disgusting $inodeni$  #qanda
"not about the glorification of war...." nek minnit: anzac dawn service fills him with optimism for this country. #qanda
I didn't gage an ounce of war glorification in this years ANZAC day, only respectful recognition. #qanda @QandA

ANZAC has been sold to us all, flag waving patriotism #qanda
What's George Constanza doing talking about the Anzacs for!? #qanda
#qanda I was at the dawn service I was not offended by scotts opinion, He has a right to say ANZACS went to war 4 free speech

If you don't believe that the attack was a war crime, go to Hiroshima and see the atomic bomb museum. Truly chilling stuff. #qanda
Interesting point from the historian re the focus on Gallipoli (at the expense of other tragedies?) #qanda
I all for free speech, I go to war for you to make it! Just leave ANZAC ancestors from my family out of it @johnsalmond @Wendy_Bacon @QandA
Thankfully, Artie's memory appears to have made a miraculous recovery. Giving a master class on the origins of WW1 #qanda
How about as well as worrying about the commercialisation of Anzac, we remember to acknowledge the NZ part too? #qanda
It's symbiotic. Politicians associate themselves with #AnzacDay because it helps their profile. They should attend as citizens.  #qanda
We are fighting different wars today. Both combat and societal wars #qanda
I HATE Modern ANZAC DAY. It's become a commercialized holiday. Look on the Woolies and Coles shelves for proof! #QandA #AusPol @QandA
Anzac Day services may not glorify war. The drunk bogans stumbling around for the rest of the day suggests something is awry. #qanda
#qanda ANZAC day should be about remembering how often we send our kids to die for nothing.
ANZAC is unfortunately being manipulated to promote an ever increasing nationalism in Aus #qanda
The politics has shifted the sentiment almost completely to the commercialised politicised event. #qanda
Get this treasonous Taxpayer funded shit off air now! These leftist pricks telling us we're glorifying war. #Theirabc glorifies ISIS! #qanda
how about woolworths and ANZAC..? the fresh food people #qanda

Young liberals in the crowd straining to keep their arms up. PICK ME! #qanda
Bullshit Sinodinos, Liberals have hijacked Anzac for political gain for years #qanda
For those thinking ANZAC day glorifies war,  TALK TO A VETERAN - you might change your mind #qanda
#qanda how similar are we now to oppression and being ordered what to think and say leave ANZAC spirit alone
Quite a proportion of our country think we won. :( #qanda
I feel this years ANZAC day was over commercialised. #qanda I didn't like it &amp; didn't participate.
Yes, but they're talking about politicians taking it over. #qanda
Anzac has been hijacked by the marketers. Anything for a dollar. $$$ #QandA
#qanda We always need to remember war to remind ourselves that we should avoid it.
Why are we spending 100 million on a war memorial in France when we can't support remote communities? #qanda @qanda

ANZAC is about the narrative of our identity not glorifying war #qanda
Only certain people set out to glorify war. Don't confuse war games and ANZAC Day. It's about honouring and remembering #qanda
I don't think killing Turks 100 years ago did THAT much for our national security. #qanda #ujcomm2657
Any values worth their salt shouldn't need war to unveil them. #QandA
Building community spirit is long overdue #qanda
ANZAC Day isn't about glorifying war. It's about respecting the fallen. Always has. Always will. #qanda
Quick, let's all down a pint and cheers to the ANZACs like Tony #qanda
Keating got ANZAC right. Only PM in recent years who didn't try to "cash in" politically on the popularity of the commemorative day. #qanda
Is it me or does Arthur bear a striking resemblence to George Costanza? #qanda
I thin ANZAC Day is perceived as a win, not a defeat. Which is just flat wrong. #qanda
#QandA don't forget it was the Japanese that started ww11
Glorifying war means it's easier for current leaders to sell new, pointless wars to the public. #qanda
Didn't the PM called Gallipoli a "splendid failure"? #QandA
@QandA #qanda McIntyre will probably get a better employer.
#qanda Keating was a thinker who read history! The Howard generations have been brainwashed. Pre WW1 Australia was doing fine
Spot on, politicians are riding on the back of ANZAC Day and its popularity. No need for them to be involved #qanda
#QandA Abbott does it cos he thinks it will get him votes &amp; he likes men in uniforms
My question for the panel: why don't I have a boyfriend will I be forever alone? #qanda
@QandA #qanda Surprised with his memory problem, Arthur can remember any history at all!
#qanda Sinodinos talks about people's bad judgement. Ask about his role with Sydney Water.
What victories? Vietnam? @QandA
Where's the token Asian in the audience? #QandA
Anzac Day was a time to reflect on the people lost and horrors endured nor a celebration of mates hip #qanda

@QandA Bali 9 executions have not been postponed, appeal will be conducted after their death at this stage #bali9
@qanda #qanda #McIntyre Tweets seem like fair comment to me. No more simplistic than the ANZAC jingoism. E. Obeid brought SBS into disrepute
It is glorified though. #qanda
Yes, but we looked at Anzac for two solid weeks and it was traumatic focussing constantly on something so horrible #qanda
This euphoria of Anzac seems to be growing by the day. So much for not glorifying the war. #qanda
First they ignore my Avengers thing, now they've got George Costanza on! #qanda
C'mon - they were teenage boys who didn't have a clue what they were getting into  #qanda
For me ANZAC is not just what was done but what can be done if the time comes. #qanda
So many people complained we didn't get a day off for ANZAC day. So Sad! #qanda
#qanda The Anzacs fought for freedom of speech. Lest we forget
#qanda turnbill is watching you tweet ! - #stopdataretention  this  govt cant handle the truth
Remembering only 'mateship' means that you forget the most important lessons that the ANZACs suffered to teach us #qanda #auspol
#qanda it is critical we remember, if we forget we will forget the horror.
More outside play, creativity &amp; exercise in nature using energy; kids connect with each other - remember playing soldiers up a tree? #QandA
Anzac Day glorifies our service men and women. As it should. #qanda
#qanda Anzac has become a "major event" for politicians.
Is it a sacrifice or a dreadful loss? #qanda
The reason Anzac Day has become such a big deal in Australia, is that politicians have *made* it a big deal over the past 20 years. #qanda
@QandA Too many pollies and clerics involved in Anzac Day. They take the humanity away. Should be about communities and families.
If the Germans won the first world war, would there be a second world war? #qanda
Our glorification of war combines fairy floss and pornography. It's totally weird. #qanda
#qanda http://t.co/R2lrqGwDHF
#QandA  Not sure what is more annoying - ANZAC Day or Christmas - Both highly commercialised events.
@P4217 maybe now we have been immunized against the jingoism of Anzac 'celebrations' we can safely forget it in future #qanda #anzac100
#QandA  What happens to the returned soldiers now - it is a disgrace
It sounds like ANZAC day means different things to different people. Isn't that ok? Or is different, bad?   #qanda
People are often canonised in death. Doesn't erase their pasts though. #qanda
Arthur Sinodinos uses - perfectly - the word "recrudescence" on @QandA. Golf clap.
Carolyn Holbrook's reservations re ANZAC seem more about commercialization than "glorification". Surprised. #QandA
It's important that children learn the history of ANZACs @QandA #QandA
Celebration of ANZAC is to say may we never let the powers to be send our sons and daughters to a 'Wasteful Slaughter'. #LestWeForget #QandA
#QandA The truth is Hake and Keating saw the chance to increase the younger vote by participating in ANZAC day.
I'd much prefer the values of truth, honesty and standing up to larger powers #qanda
Why is ok for VB to lean on the ANZAC name? #QandA
@QandA without the sacrifice of the ANZACS, we wouldn't have the freedom to ask such dumb questions #qanda
How about we allow criticism? That might stop the glorification.  #qanda
If we wanted to glorify war we would pick a war where we won, The frontier wars for example. #qanda
Can anyone else hear the #ivy in the background? #qanda
It's not Anzac Day anymore coz they r almost all dead . Now it's #brandzac day #QandA
Anzac day has become politicized and is an embarrassment- it's a day for individual reflection. #qanda
Tony Abbott used ANZAC Day to launch another war campaign- referring to it as "the new generation of ANZACs" ... where does it end #QandA
If tens of thousands of young Australians hadn't died in WW1, imagine how much worse the traffic would be today. #qanda
if it were not for the ANZACs odds are all these edgy people couldn't whinge about anything on twitter at all. be greatful sooks #qanda
Who are these people who say ANZAC Day glorifies war? Clearly they've never been to a dawn service #qanda
#qanda it's not a coincidence that Abbott's approval rating has increased around ANZAC time
Liberal party war mongering has delivered us IS so I dn't think we should listen to them about anythng to do with war #qanda eva
yeah if the germans had won we might not had the second world war. imagine if marty mcfly went back and did that shit #qanda
The Anzac spirit now encompasses so much more than Gallipoli #qanda
@QandA #qanda there's a huge difference between original ANZACS and current well-paid, professional military
#qanda
#qanda those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it
Aussies will always resist the idea that Anzac Day should glorify war #qanda
#Qanda. PM calling WWI just. That's offensive
Really glad I'm in bed....no #qanda
If we don't glorify war how will we get new recruits? #qanda
@Qanda Australian government spending hyping Anzac is vast, bigger than even UK WWI memorial bedget.
#QandA not glorifying, remembering the effort, the failure, the mateship, the stoicism. How would we cope today in same conditions?
#qanda Can someone tell me why Sinodinis is lecturing us about morals?
Being a parent Phil, isn't that your role to educate your children on the differences in your question on #qanda tonight?
If only beyond blue was around during the depression #qanda
I enjoyed learning the word "recrudescence" from Arthur Sinodinos on @qanda tonight.
WWI and WWII were a 30 years war, just with a depression in the middle #qanda

Every nation needs it's own politically palatable myth of wartime heroism #QandA
#qanda  https://t.co/oHPAyL8i04
#qanda WW2 Australian soldiers were disguised in English uniforms when they fought in Egypt because of the poor reputation left by WW1
The VB advert - for Anzac Day was silly. #qanda
The worthy and important Anzac Day myth debate deserves better than some intemperate tweets. #qanda
We STILL don't handle PTSD well, Arthur. #QandA
#qanda why aren't we putting the same resources into peace as we are into war?
@QandA @ABCthedrum
#qanda we glorify war yet have so many sick and homeless vets
Anzac Day is not Christmas. Shouldn't be any commercial exploiting of ANZAC. Looking at you woollies! #qanda
We may commemorate their sacrifice, but we must never 'celebrate' it... #qanda
When I hear the war justifications tonight I hear the same justifications that are attributed to jihadists...  #qanda

"first to salute our troops send em prayers, an the first to give the middle finger to the ####s who sent em there.." @qanda
#qanda We plead to avoid the death penalty but glorify organisations that have sent men and women to their death for years. Hypocrisy?
@jofmcmanus @QandA Bugger! As a West Aussie temp in ES I sympathise.We are still poor cousins.Lobby @GeoffHutchison !!! (Bet he has a feed)
#QandA do we also remember how the UK sent the soldiers there to be slaughtered?
Tony Abbott has relentlessly exploited the Anzacs for his own political ends #qanda

Pollies love to jump on the #ANZAC bandwagon. Appearing in a flak jacket is a sure fire vote winner. #QandA
The ANZACS fought for  brand loyalty #qanda
Lest We Forget in and of itself highlights a commemoration and remembrance of the ANZACs, no glorification of a war. #qanda
.@SigmundMarx has a point...Anzac has become popular &amp; so politicians have reacted to the popularity #qanda
ANZAC Day should honour all Australian veterans and their service #qanda
@QandA can we speak for @JulianAssange_ against the United States with the same media rigour?
I'm more worried about the misuse of #Anzac as propaganda for young people looking for an 'honourable' path, than commercialisation. #qanda
#qanda Can any one explain how the massacre of the ANZAC diggers secured our freedom?!
imagine, just for a moment what Anzac Day would be like without alcohol #qanda
If war came to Australia today we'd all suddenly have a lot more respect for our army. #QandA
@QandA remembering heroes of nation is not glorifying war.
Why is my cousin's husband such a piece of shit? #QandA

@QandA Politicians have always been a Stink around Whatever is Popular and draws a crowd !! Remember Peter Beatty he was everywhere!!
No one wins in war. Except for weapons manufacturers. #qanda
It is the commercialisation of ANZAC Day that has began to glorify it, and caused it to be celebrated not commemorated #QandA #UJCOMM2657
If the Germans had won wwii we'd not have all that much free speech #qanda oh hang on

We should have "weapons of mass destruction day" to remember the lie that cost millions of lives @qanda
It's not brave to sign up to put yourself at the mercy of the whims of cowardly and inept politicians - it's foolish #qanda
Word of the day: "Recrudescence". Thanks Arthur. #qanda
there has ALWAYS been organised opposition to Australian wars by Australians, why can't we celebrate that? we silence that history #qanda

Hey Arthur are you still taking donations for the party I have some mates that want to give us money? #qanda
Now we are asked to believe that jingoism is what Aussie consumers demanded #qanda
#QandA so the politicians get to celebrate sending these soldiers to war... Yeah that makes sense.
...as we send troops to the middle east. #qanda
If ANZAC Day is about remembering the war, why don't we tell the story as it is, and highlight the heroes of the other side? #qanda
Such eloquence from Tim Fischer. A style &amp; substance missing from current @LiberalAus coalition leadership. #qanda #auspol

Want to honour the ANZACs? Support them when they come home: Don't leave them homeless and destitute after suffering PTSD #qanda
As Aussie citizens we have no right to criticise, much less question the ANZACs; we should just say thank you, and be on our way. #QandA
#qanda @QandA  people are looking for ways to create community, pushing back against divisive government policies!!
National enthusiasm to honour ANZACs will inevitably manifest in jingoism in some quarters  #qanda
That's nice that Tim Fisher recognizes what Monash has done considering good ol' Billie Hughes was an antisemite #qanda

#qanda British empire are the biggest murderers  along with Japan, Chinese Opium Wars in 1900 good see Poms got payback murdered in Galipoli
Anzac Day could be a day to being much needed attention to the aftermath of war which is so poorly understood, funded and supported. #QandA
I disagree. Governments do go to war taking it very lightly. Especially when they think it will help politically. #qanda
#QandA Armed Forces are sent to war by the democratically elected government of the day. We should remember their sacrifice.
Why is it that the hawks of war rarely are the ones to fight &amp; to die in them? #QandA
Fuk you!!!! My family didnt fight for worthless fukheads like you to prosper &amp; spread filth! @johnsalmond @Wendy_Bacon @QandA
Don't discredit or demean their struggle or their sacrifice. It's so easy for Gen Y to make brash judgement calls on this. #qanda
Is it Holbrook's academic opinion that describing the bombings of Nagasami &amp; Hiroshima as terrorism makes people become jihadis? #qanda
Kinda weird that @newscomauHQ is live tweeting #qanda when you can just watch it if you're interested
how can sinodinos remember the 60s/70s? #qanda
Arfur quoting #Abbott's selective, bullshit speech. #qanda
My mum just asked if Arthur could be struck by lightning!  #qanda
Did Abbott mention the $5 co-payment during his Anzac speech?  #qanda
Is the celebration of sacrifice necessarily a valorisation of militarism? @qanda #qanda

I think we spend too much time and money on International Women's Day. When was that again? #qanda
ANZAC Day teaches children about sacrifice, freedom and hope #qanda
How does the Australian media like the idea of aNZac Day ? #QandA
#qanda to put Anzac Day back into perspective, the act of remembrance needs to go back to being a church function.
@jimmywheelz The last private soldier veteran of the Gallipoli campaign has died. Anzac Day has become a celebration of war. #QandA
I was horrified by war after watching episodes of Captain Power and The Soldiers of the Future. #QandA
We seem to be quite keen to spend $ on killing but not for aid. Interesting. #QandA
Why do these ppl "asking" questions read of paper? #qanda
The correlation between politicians interest in Anzac day and their enthusiasm to join to wars of choice is close to 1 #qanda
Trick them into going to war by spouting false values, then pretend they died for our freedom #qanda
We still don't deal with returned soldiers PTSD #QandA
Stop using the world celebrate about ANZAC Day commemorate &amp; remember but not celebrate poor wording Arthur et al @QandA  #qanda
And what does this have to do with video games? #qanda
Of course our modern day veterans receive only the best support for their PTSD and homelessness. #Qanda
#QandA my father World War II, celebrated in silence like a lot of his peers.

Anzac Day has become a forced day of mourning, propagated a great deal by the media. It's a shame that it's got to this point really. #qanda
You want an intelligent Anzac comment? Get that dude with the red teatowel Peter Fitzonions on the panel to talk it up. #qanda
It's glamorisation of warfare if you refuse to mention PSTD as a likely affect. #qanda #ujcomm2657 @QandA
Commemoration involves reflecting upon the realities of war, not the jingoistic palava dished up before ANZAC Day this year. #qanda
Did Arthur just use recrudescence in a sentence?! Showing your age #QandA

#qanda I think that Anzac Day is our de facto national day because Australia was started with a vote and that's just not glamorous.
@JohnSafran this diatribe is crying out for your tweets #qanda
#qanda Australia Day- racist. ANZAC day- glorifies war. Christmas- insensitive to non-Christians. New Year's Eve- yet to be decided

What about the war on our own streets #qanda
#qanda has anyone mentioned Peter Weir yet? His magnificent stirring movie is almost completely responsible for the modern Anzac cult.
Lest we forget? The phrase ought to be "lest we repeat". #qanda

"We should not allow the honouring of the dead to obscure the reality that war is hell." @tomporteous #qanda @qanda http://t.co/lMFOEqA6S5
I'm worried too Tom. #qanda
@qanda. Tragic loss of young lives sent in as canon fodder!  100 years later we have learnt nothing about the folly of war. #qanda.
Students in Australia don't learn what actually happens in war. All we learn about is Australia's involvement in war. #qanda
"I don't think any government goes lightly into war to be honest." BAHAHAHAHA. Good one. #QandA
Soldier sacrifice is eternally heroic. War is eternally repulsive. Regardless of its so-called necessity. #qanda
Support the troops, not the cause. The powers that convinced young men that war was necessary is the real and terrifying evil #qanda
Thank you Tom. We must not forget that with war, come atrocities. On both sides. It's inevitable. #qanda
@MKPS001 @QandA You're confusing terrorism with war. They're not the same thing.
The further we go in time from 1915 the more the #anzac story will become a glorified, crystallised legend. #notgd #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Wilfred Owen should be compulsory reading for everyone. Captures the agony of war. #qanda
@QandA was the TV coverage of #gallipoli this year way too much? #qanda
Pretending no war crimes were ever committed by Australians is blind denial. #Qanda
#qanda remember the children of #Gaza who were killed by Israel. We don't need to look far to find "war" stories
Does England celebrate a day when Nepolian was beaten? #qanda
War makes 'man' (generic) animalistic. That is a fact. #QandA
How do you stop wars? Send the politicians children to war first. #qanda
@QandA Politicians are responsible for sending these people to invade turkey . #QandA
Remembering the death and demise of war is important honouring those who have fallen, but it is important to send the right message #qanda
Shouldn't it be called BRANDZAC day now? #qanda
So shall we cancel ANZAC day next year for fear of offending the uneducated and unappreciative. #qanda
It's hard to think 9000 Australians lost their lives in such a short amount of time. Hence the 'legend' and 'myth' labels. #qanda
We should remember the tragedy of war and make sure it doesn't happen again  #qanda
We can do without ANZAC hoodies and stubby holders. #qanda
Can we send Arthur's mate John Howard for war crimes yet? #qanda
@havyatt @QandA @TurnbullMalcolm Sycophants abound it seems with the lunatics in power.
The commercialisation takes away from the true meaning. It's all about making money. #qanda
#qanda why don't we ask veterans what they would like to see happen on ANZAC day
#qanda Wake up Tim
Sorry to interrupt #QandA but can I ask for some listeners tomorrow please?
This huts makes too much sense. Can't we just use Goodies and Baddies again? #qanda
Anzac Day has increasingly become a left/right issue. It was supposed to bring us together. #qanda
#qanda those who say ANZAC commemorations glorify war, have you ever been to a dawn service? when during the service was war glorified?
@QandA how could anyone defend him?! It was poorly timed and in poor taste!! I like a drink and a bet but that doesn't make me less than gim
Tim fisher looks bored. What's up Tim #qanda
War is hell , always has been, always will be! #qanda
If only we'd learned from that war that it should never happen again #QandA
ANZAC revival is a luxury of generations who claim credit for ancestors who fought without leaving their lounge rooms. #qanda
Really disappointed in the consistent marketing of Anzac. HAVE SOME RESPECT #qanda
#QandA and how does the government support the veterans after their return?
Yes. Australians committed war crimes. Lots of them. Your sense of national identity has just been shattered. You're fucken welcome #qanda
This guy is my new favourite other Tom #qanda
#qanda a lot of heartbreaking discussion tonight
Tom Porteous summing it up nicely #QandA
Guy in the black jacket #NailsIt #QandA
What does the Panel think of the new trend in Turkey to argue Gallipoli was a religious Jihadi war? #qanda
Coming from Canada, ANZAC celebrations are like no other in the world. Huge, unnecessary celebrations for months in advance #qanda
Woah! More leftie heads exploding re Tom Porteous' wise comments re ANZAC, poppies etc. Rough night for the little poppets ... #QandA
A #qanda panel, with the possible exception of Tom Porteus, rallying in support of the 'extreme centre' - dissent on Anzac myth not on.
#QandA USA is weary of wars, yet patriotism warrants security measures before it hits at home. #overthere. #NIMBY
"In war, even on our side, there are brutal atrocities and war crimes" - Porteous. Scott, that's how you should have said it #qanda
@QandA war is about scarce resources and greedy corporations and their political donations !!
@QandA #qanda Soldiers don't decide to go to war. Pollies do. Lucky the adults are in charge. Not.
THANK YOU, British man. #qanda
@QandA no one comes back from war normal again. Their souls are destroyed
Aw. #qanda
#Gallipoli We haven't forgotten. But have we learned anything? Like how to end a war without planting the seeds of next war? #anzac #qanda
The war machine benefits the ruling class &amp; nobody else #qanda
If the circumstances of WW1 were repeated in modern times, humanity would probably destroy itself. #qanda
No legend should ever be used to cover over brutal acts of violence and death. #QandA
@QandA #qanda Arms manufacturers need wars to survive. Politicians deliver for them #auspol
Anzac Day #qanda Not glorifying war: reflecting on courage, pain of combatants, nurses "over there"; workers, families "back home"
no way white people don't do war crimes, they're brave &amp; honourable #qanda
#qanda we should send our politicians to war! They should fight it! Not civilians! @QandA
still at war 100 yrs later, we remember nothing #qanda
Wars ruin families..WWI for my Grandfather and WWII took my uncle's life &amp; broke the hearts of his whole family. #qanda
@QandA Only the dead have seen the end of war (Plato)
Let's not "celebrate" the sacrifice of service men &amp; women in wars since WWI, let's commemorate it! #qanda
I hate how we need a narrative about returned serviceman. Many of them chose not to attend services. They have a diversity of opinion #qanda
Is Uncle Arthur in the audience or was that Norman Gunston? #qanda
That is the point McIntyre was trying to make, soldiers on all sides committed war crimes #qanda
#qanda Well said!!
Wars never go to plan. If they did both sides would win. #QandA
Does the #qanda social media team ever pay attention to the Twitter handles they put to air?
Some of our soldiers committed atrocities Some still do. The invisible war rages on #QandA
#qanda http://t.co/E9nNVUgxTU
War should be avoided at all costs, not as a tool to build national pride. #qanda
Tom Porteous making sound points #QandA
Australia doesn't have a cultural identity,  we're willing to cling onto anything we can #qanda
I think we've moved significantly away from the so-called ANZAC legend when you can buy ANZAC branded sleeping bags. #qanda
Criticizing a nation for remembering its dead ..He should join the mad Westboro Baptist Church #qanda
#qanda Sorry Fisher,  2 tours in Vietnam, was at the dawn service and I haven no problem with McIntosh's comments.
War is hell. Sounds like a pretty accurate description.  #QandA
Only those over 50 years of age should go to war #qanda
I'd rather chill in a shark tank than watch the rest of #qanda tonight. Good night!
Tim Fisher on Mabo. Lest we forget. http://t.co/gBGWYXLmgm #QandA
The goosebumps on your skin &amp; the tears that fill your eyes, they arent from remembering a war, they are from remembering the ANZACs #QandA
The cruelty &amp; finality of the death penalty far outweighs the crime committed #QandA
What? Mateship and courage didn't exist in Australia before 1915? #qanda
very true, Tom Porteus; war is used as a figurehead to justify #QandA #UJCOMM2657
Maybe the Leaders should be put in to a Boxing ring and not involve others.  #QandA
#QandA Lest we forget
War is hell? Oh. I thought it was a fabulous opportunity to make great mates &amp; create lasting national narratives. #qanda
#QandA Old men start wars, young people fight them. Sad indeed!
Do we really need politicians sending us to war and executing people? @qanda
Sorry but they're not "celebrations". They are solemn commemorations. Hige difference. #qanda
This man goes too far with his truth speaking #qanda
Not just war... "On water matters" #QandA
Old men sending young men to death #LestWeForget #QandA
you can support your soldeirs and not support war #qanda
Oh really..! I don't think any gov't goes to war lightly.. Do you include Mr Jump the Gun #Abbott in that Arfur..? #qanda
#qanda  Australians wearing Gallipoli beanies and sweatshirts to the service at Lone Pine - I thought they were at a footie grand final.
It's not about glorification it's just about remembering the fallen and the victims...that's all #qanda
@camo013 We shall never forget our ANZACS! 1/3 of our population at the time fought and died for our freedom. Lest we forget forever #QandA
Sinodinos is on #qanda and all the audience can manage is to debate history. Ask about AWH. Ask about ICAC. Question his competence.
Jingo jingo jingo lots more fucking jingos #qanda
#qanda  OUR FAMILIES ARE STILL PAYING THE PRICE OF OUR BROKEN GRANDPARENTS AND OUR NEVER TO BE BORN COUSINS
Acknowledging the fallen &amp; their lives, is not seeking to deny the atrocities of war. THINK of how these men &amp; women died. #qanda
Should war and celebrations be used in the same sentence? #qanda
The younger generation isn't "getting into ANZAC day" to glorify war, it's to play 2-up and drink beer #QandA
#qanda One hundred years on many still unable to accept or speak the truths of war. Lest we forget the unthinkable.
There is a drive to make Aussies more pro war and thankfully we all have been repulsed by it. #qanda
Hint: there is no 'real meaning' of Anzac, we make it up as we go along. #qanda
Diggers fought for the free speech all Aussies have, but there's a line that decency &amp; respect demands we don't cross. He crossed it #QandA
You cant change history, only learn from it. Shouldn't we respect the memory of sacrifices made so we can enjoy the freedom we have #qanda
When did ANZAC day become a celebration rather than a commemoration ? #QandA
@QandA Soldiers are OK. Government's Pfft! Howard didn't ask 75% Aust said No put politicians in trenches leave soldiers homr
@Qanda To Arthur Sinodinus. How can you justify a Salary of $3Million for bugger all work for one of Eddie Obeids Companies? #qanda
#Qanda ANZAC  was young men becoming more than nationalism but mateship....
This guy is probably a hard out marxist but he's hiding it pretty well #qanda
John Howard jumped at the change to go to war. Tony Abbott jumps at any opportunity to go to war. #qanda
#qanda All very noble sentiments, but the reality is that you are only guilty of a war crime if you lose the war.
#qanda Killing hundreds of thousands with atomic bombs is only a war crime if you lose the war
Tim Fischer has left the building! #qanda
ANZAC day is the emproers new unifrom #qanda
My father and grandfather fought in each war. Both were clear that they wanted nothing further to do with remembering it. #qanda
@QandA isn't it time we honour our soldiers that are living? | http://t.co/qVWb4uiedc #PTSD #ANZAC #qanda http://t.co/XkahAL5FdX
#Qanda WOW did this guy just say what @mcintinhos said? and he got fired for it because zionist @TurnbullMalcolm  had a public sook about it
@Rachel_Worsley they r not fighting in the west against west, they r fighting in islamic country for a start, so does not seem right? @QandA
"Civilians suffer in war." Now who woulda thought it? Free refugees! #qanda
ANZAC commemorations teach me of the horrors and futilities of war. Keep it going. #qanda
@QandA @TurnbullMalcolm the guy  was employed as sports reporter. Tuff if want to provide social commentary.
Aboriginal families were profoundly impacted from their men returning from war in a country who didn't consider them one of their own #qanda

What shade of blonde should I dye my hair? #QandA
@jwwr @forthleft Don't overlook the RSLs, the pokie palaces benefitting from grog &amp; pokies.. @QandA
#QandA Carolyn just accused an SBS journo of potentially fuelling jihadists with his comments and then contradicted this comment. Qua?
There was no conscription in WW1. It's popular to blame politicians, but they walked in voluntarily #qanda
So Arfur has come out of his lock-up #qanda
@annabelcrabb @QandA I might try me some of that recrudescence!
Like so many things, American jingoism and marketing opportunity has crept in. Australia Day the same #ANZAC @qanda
#qanda is delayed here
Hear hear @tomporteous #qanda
#qanda definitely think there is a problem with the commercialization of ANZAC. We really need to keep it as a sacred part of our society
Print the legend, the truth is too painful #qanda
Glorifying of Anzac reinforces class privilege: middle class officers ordering the working class to run out as cannon fodder #qanda
Our cultural identity began over 60,000 years ago #QANDA
YES we should respect those who fought for us, but NO we should not condone war atrocities committed by ANYONE #qanda #ujcomm2657
Anyone who knows anything about Asia knows that "rage", so popular in Australia, is utterly pointless in Asia.  Folly, weakness. #qanda
#qanda reinstate McIntyre to SBS. This conversation has been stimulated by his freedom of speech.
If we all learned about all the true realities of war, including children, it might help prevent them in the future. #qanda
There was no way the USA could resist dropping the A Bombs! It cost them so much in time and treasure. #QandA
History books are always written by the victors... #qanda
@annabelcrabb @QandA has his memory come back ?
#qanda
Had the allies lost WWI, would Anzac Day and our meaning of war be vastly different? #qanda
#QandA we just need to make sure that ANZAC Day is not commercialized
How about we move some of the military budget to the aid budget? #QandA
The victors write history and big business then cashes in! #qanda
I think it's about time Australians stopped projecting their values onto the ANZAC soldiers #qanda
@qanda There are no winners in war. Everyone loses to some degree. #qanda
#qanda @QandA Was time when Anzac remembrance was fading. There should be acknowledgement of role of schools valuing of Anzac ethos.
From NZ perspective of ANZAC - not part of the foundation myth. We have a treaty and celebrate that  #qanda
@MdmAbsentMinded @QandA Yeahhh....no.
The afl uses anzacs as advertising for the Anzac clashes #QandA
"sorry I missed that question" "uh, it's your question" LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL almost choked to death there #qanda
Well said!! War is hell...we can honour our soldiers but lets be realistic. No need to glorify war.. #qanda

Do these people understand what ANZAC day is? I don't think it means what they think it means. #Qanda

Vietnam War. What a pointless, pointless war. #qanda
Why do we focus on Gallipoli instead of Boer - or think of the civilian casualties the allies inflicted #qanda
Go matey! #QandA
@QandA   Why doesn't he join the ABCs Chasers! War in Everything! He would fit right in
Abbott would love a war, has been offering our defences forces personnel even when not wanted #qanda
#qanda There is a difference between commemorate and celebrate.
#QandA I do like this HRW guy - talks a lot of sense
Uncle Tony wants YOU #qanda
The idea that ANZACs were anti-war is largely retrospective. They were only anti after they realised it wasn't the fun they hoped for #qanda
commemorate not never ever celebrate #QandA
Am I ignorant, but what was WWI about? #qanda
War was not glorified at any service I went to. Somber would be more accurate. #ANZAC #QandA
I wonder what would have happened in 2015 if feminists had protested at ceremonies about rape in war #QandA @QandA
The history of war is put to us by historians - it's made to be palatable. #qanda #war
Fischer's unimpressed. #qanda
#qanda ScottMcIntyre made provocative statements that have spurred discussion on alternate views of war. He should be celebrated for this.
People die in wars. That should be the incentive not to participate in them. #qanda
#qanda And now we spend $100M for a war memorial in France
I have felt increasing uncomfortable with the ANZAC day 'legend' and the creeping towards celebration, not remembrance #qanda
I believe that the ANZACS showed the spirit of mateship and egalitarianism that we still have #qanda
You go dude #qanda
"Australian military history is not written by the people who actually fought the wars" #qanda

ASK THE AUDIENCE  Who on ANZAC day celebrates war?  V  Who is there to remember the sacrifices made?  #qanda #auspol
War stories should be told by people who have experienced the horror. #qanda
#qanda follow me on twitter dot com
Military history is not written by those who fight the wars. It's written by politicians, sanitising the reality of the war. #qanda
#qanda Get ICAC to the studio now -If Sinodinas can remember the word recrudescence maybe he can remember about Sydney Water and LNP funding
#qanda not everyone values life that's the problem!
#ANZAC100 hysteria just a lead-in to getting our young "leaners" conscripted to be boots-on-ground in Iraq/Syria? #qanda
ANZAC Day is not a celebration, it's a commemoration. #qanda
If Carolyn says "right wing" again. I'm going to chant. "I know you are, you said you are..." #qanda
It is always a distinct pleasure to hear from Vietnam vets - they get none of the credit but experienced all of the horror #qanda
@QandA #QandA QandA?  LIVE TV?  Why must you be 1/2 hour Delayed into SA?  Why?  You're pissing me off.  I bet you don't even care.
First casualty of war... #Qanda
I did a double-take: Thought one of the residents here at the retirement village had escaped. Then realised it was just Tim Fischer. #qanda
#qanda Military history is never written by the people who had to do the actual dirty work.
@Qanda Australian government spending to hype Anzac day is vast, much bigger than even UK WWI memorial budget.
Yes sure - we should remember wars and those who died/etc in them - and the reason we should is so we also remember not to have wars! #QandA
The #bali9 executions have not been postponed because of constitutional court appeal in May @QandA #qanda AG must postpone
What makes me uncomfortable is the manipulation of the ANZAC narrative by politicians pandering to the extreme right #qanda
It takes a soldier to tell the truth about war #qanda
I was a prisoner in the Cold War. How come I can't march? #QandA
@JB_AU @QandA Yes rightly so if we pay them, then we have the right to hold them to account!
War is horrendous. We must stop these Liberal war-hungry monsters from sending more troops overseas. Violence will not stop violence! #qanda

ANZAC day is a great photo op for politicians.  #qanda
I have a lot of respect for Vietnam vets. They don't get enough recognition and a lot didn't want to fight  #qanda
Actually the ANZAC Journos did what they could to make the Gallipoli battles as unpalletable to the Australian public as possible. #QandA
#qanda visit the war museum in Ho ChiMin City. That is the truth of war. Our war memorial is far from the truth
#qanda Anzac is now more about the AFL and NRL not the RSL
A refreshing perspective. #qanda
Well said, by a bloke who actually understands what war is. #QandA
Good question #qanda
#QandA @QandA My grandfather fought for NZ in WW2 and never spoke of it after his return through to his death over 10 years ago
@QandA @SigmundMarx  what a brilliant question
Well said Don Tate  #qanda
I agree with everything Tom Porteous just said. #qanda #auspol #war #AnzacDay
Let's be clear ANZAC is not a celebration but a rememberance of the horror "lest we forget" #qanda
give it a rest with the cultural cringe, people act like it's embarrassing to be proud of your country and the people who served it #qanda
The average"bronzed Aussie digger" was a teenage child... #QandA
How do we commemorate the ANZAC spirit without the glorification of warfare? #QandA panel responds http://t.co/3dbaTXNs5k
@cynicq @auntyneville664 @bluetiebloke I never watch it ever, preserve mine too #qanda give me diarrhoea
So we shut down anyone who dares disrespect our precious ANZACs but aboriginals should just get over the war against them #qanda
Vietnam vets are still putting us in our place. Well done. #QandA
@QandA #qanda there WERE horrific crimes perpetrated by the ANZACS do we teach our children about that no we do not it's bullshit
The Vietnam vet tells it like it is. #qanda
Wars are barbaric #qanda
Great observation from a Vietnam Vet about sanitising our war history #qanda
Beautiful question. #QandA
#qanda ANZAC DAY  leave it alone.Our diggers drank, gambled, cried, sweated blood and played two-up.Remember their sacrifice for us.
WW1 was NOT about fighting for "rights and freedoms" ffs...it was an Imperial Globe sharing squabble #qanda
The political use to which the Anzac myth has been put is highly disturbing, not to mention the public falling for it #qanda
If you speak to a veteran about Anzac Day, they don't celebrate or glorify the day. It's a day of reflection and respect for them. #qanda
@newscomauHQ @tomporteous @QandA thanks for your condescending input, now fuck off..
@QandA #QandA Hiroshima was bombed so US could show their might to the USSR. Japan tried to surrender 6 mths prior, but US wouldn't accept
#qanda stop bullshitting @tanya_plibersek , Australia was the 3rd biggest recipient of its own foreign aid. You fuck up everything u touch
I enjoy your question sir and you should get another. #QandA
#qanda get rid of the panel and just let Tom Porteous talk for ninety minutes.
#quanda @QandA 90% of deaths in ww1 were soldiers.  Now 90% of deaths are civilian.
Brilliant point. #qanda
Glorifying war keeps fear in the population... #qanda
Great question #qanda
Great question about truth and lies #qanda
Don Tate well said #qanda
@popculturechris Qanda is local for onions,here in Mumbai.
@Dr_Chi_Li @sonialf QandA doesn't distract me since they stopped showing it on ABC24 and I can't watch it live on my TV
It is true that Aussie soldiers did illegal things in war, and that should never be whitewashed to make Anzac Day sacred. #qanda
People wouldn't be able to handle the truth about the actual occurrences of war #QandA
The Avengers of current affairs; the logo certainly does some favours #qanda
#qanda the war is over if you want !! #makepeacenotwar
Let's get this correct... commemorate ANZAC Day, not celebrate it; it's about respect #qanda
Engage with inconvenient history, do not dismiss it #qanda
ANZAC day has been made a public holiday and what happens on a public holiday? everyone gets pissed #beers #qanda
#qanda @qanda War is horrific, but we should always honour young men and women who do what their govt asks of them
GREAT QUESTION #QandA
great question by the vietnam vet #qanda
@QandA #qanda Commemorations should be with "humble hearts" -what humanity can do to each other.
Why doesn't our parliament debate and decide if our soldiers should go to war? #qanda @qanda
War is terrible. If we knew exactly what happens in war, we'd never respect Anzac Day. #qanda
Finally we hear from a genuine returned soldier who has nothing to do with the antiseptic versions, calling out the propaganda lie #qanda
@QandA has me yelling at the tele every week but I am grateful for tonight in that I learnt a new word - requiescence.
There are a number of historians who present unsavoury arguments. It's about being careful of the word you take #qanda
#QandA the ANZACS never wanted war to be glorified. It was the war to end all wars. Lest We Forget.
Some wars are required such as WW2. Hitler &amp; the Emperor had to be stopped. WW1 wasn't. ANZACs &amp; Turks were mutually respected #qanda
Seeing people throw $100 notes around the two-up ring without understanding who the man printed on it is.... #qanda
Tony Abbott wants a nice polished, sanitised version of war! #qanda
We remember the bravery of ANZACS but not the wrongs that were done by those who ordered them #qanda
Good thing the national curriculum hasn't been politicised *cough* #QandA
listen to this man....he was there!  #vietnam  #qanda
#qanda  SO BLOODY RIGHT OLD MATE
@Henjam48 @QandA I'd work 4 Eddie
@broaderstory the boys from the bush being sent to their deaths by the British city slickers mythos is glorifying it #Qanda
I'm still waiting for last week's promised discussion of the #TPP Not happening? #qanda When will we celebrate Vietnam's &amp; Iraq's vets?
Respect to this Vet and every other who put their life on the line #qanda
The fact is that telling the truth about war would be terrible for the ADF's recruitment. #qanda
#qanda face it ANZAC day an excuse for fake patriotism ..
Fresh in our memories #qanda
#qanda  This Viet Vet is speaking real sense and expresses exactly my intuitions about ANZAC today
Before I attended a dawn service this year I, too, thought ANZAC day glorified war - couldn't have been further from the truth! #QandA
The Eternal Mantra of War: We are the good and They are the bad #qanda
What a brave man! True bravery is to face the truth. #qanda
#qanda there is a different in respecting the war dead vs. supporting any future wars lead by USA and Britain now ... #2015
Fantastic question from the Vietnam vet #qanda
Lest we need the support on our shoreline one day #qanda
History owes the dead the truth. #qanda
There are votes in associating with Anzac day, national disasters, terrorism raids. Common denominator? Patriotism and jingoism #qanda
The Greeks still commemorate the heroic feats of the 300 Spartans and that was 2500 years ago... and they lost too #qanda
Old soliders getting up and criticising the current #AnzacDay myth better be careful - they could lose their pensions.  #qanda

@annabelcrabb @QandA Why? Ridiculous choice of word for almost any occasion...
@mjosqh if you don't like war video games buy car racing video games. #QandA
Our politicians should visit the war museum in Ho Chi Minh. They don't sanitize what we did to them. #qanda
Do you have proof of that outrageous claim against the AWM @qanda #qanda
Military history is revisionist and tends to glorify past battles and ignores our own atrocities. #qanda
Kudos to this fab, gutsy questioner #qanda
Great question on the war memorial's sanitisation of our war history! #QandA
Last night I saw the wonderful opera Aida. Theatre showed the false glorification of war v human suffering. @QandA

I would rather hear about war from a veteran than a historian  #qanda
MiniTruth is usually pretty busy rewriting the script. #Qanda
ANZAC day doesn't glorify war. It honours those men and women who fought and died for their country. #qanda
Ooh, this guy makes a little bit too much sense. #qanda
Watching this with a Belgian whose hometown was bombed to the ground during WW2 is interesting. #qanda
I wonder if that question is going to get that questioner sacked too? #qanda

Records of war should never be sanitised #qanda
@qanda case in point in Vietnam THAT war is called the American War.
#QandA politicians can also believe untruths as a convenient truth to go to war as did Bush, Blair &amp; Howard.
The winners of wars write the history @QandA #QandA
#qanda Lest we forget is about never forgetting the sacrifice and paying tribute, but also to never forget atrocity and futility of war.
The victors of war only provide half historical truths. #qanda
#qanda The sacrifice of our young ANZACs should never be forgotten as students at Villers Bretonneux r reminded in their playground everyday
I honour the people who laid down their lives for their country. To be responsible for their homeland, not glorifying war #qanda
our soldiers did not die for politicians &amp; political parties to use as propaganda and patriotism #qanda
"In defense of historians" - nothing good can follow this statement #qanda
Brilliant question that #QandA
#QandA There needs to be more education about WOLRD HISTORY- very few young people have a grasp of the past, including the world wars.
@MariamVeiszadeh Let's not forget this -- did @TurnbullMalcolm called @FOXSportsAUS with his concerns?  #qanda  http://t.co/Naf4vA5FfS
1915 was dumb, we were a soverigen country fighting for England. How dumb were we! #qanda
#qanda we must never forget the horror, Anzac day helps us to remember. Lest We Forget.
We should only have critical views of War. #QandA #AusPol @QandA
#qanda We need to understand war stories past and present @qanda
#qanda Thank goodness for a Viet Vet to tell it like  it is.
#qanda the truth of War is always kept away from the public
@Doclach Or unable to operate back in the 'real' world. #qanda
Not tweeting tonight's #qanda politicking of Anzac legendary gratification and social media etiquette. Scott McIntrye tweeted too crudely.
#qanda imagine if Japan wanted to remember the bombing of Darwin with a monument. 235 Aussies killed?
Perhaps one day Vietnam vets will be deified too #qanda
@tomporteous is killing it on #qanda tonight. A refreshing external voice in a country which doesnt like being lectured to about rights
All history is created to serve a purpose #QandA
@peteevansnot @QandA they might be homeless but at least they'll be spared the scourge of gluten
Top question, Mr Vietnam Vet. Historian goes into immediate denial. #qanda
What a sad indictment on human history, the importance placed on protecting the legend of success, righteousness and bravery in war. #QandA
Honor the lives, remember the deaths, question the sacrifice #qanda
What impact does all this politicking have on our veterans? #qanda
@qanda #qanda a century on and nothing has changed. we're still sending our soldiers to fight other people's wars.
Wars are funded off budget deficits, the right's worst nightmare. #qanda
#qanda My family others lived with concequences of WarThey were told to go home not talk about it so they did not they found abottle instead
ANZAC and Remembrance day are in place not to glorify but to remember so that we don't have another WW #qanda
Since we are all using the fucking hashtag #qanda I WANT TO EXPRESS HOW PISSED OFF I AM THAT AUFC ARE NOT PLAYING AT HINDMARSH IN CAPS
#QandA Good point. Let us hear it more from the people who were there. Keep it real.
Celebrate the fallen. But don't leave those left behind unacknowledged. The fight continued back home. #qanda
@QandA #qanda The problem is that history is written by the winners #auspol
A powerful question from the gentleman who is a Vietnam Veteran #qanda
Abbott &amp; Gov is damned if they do or don't on #Bali9 already been criticized here for linking to foreign aid #qanda
No recognition of frontier wars in war memorial #qanda
Oh really..! I don't think any gov't goes to war lightly.. Do you include Mr Jump the Gun #Abbott in that Arfur..? #qanda
Guy on radio last week said he had PTSD coz his father and grandfather went to war. #qanda
While remembering the brave honorable soldiers, we must also never forget those like Breaker Morant. #qanda
History is the lies the victors tell themselves. If you keep repeating a lie it becomes fact #qanda
@QandA The ADF toil away in many other areas beside war zones. Target the pollies who move this vunerable group around like 'pawns'!
Didn't know rewriting of war history was going on #qanda
It's not about glorifying it's bout quantifying #qanda
My grandfather was in WW2 he never wanted to go but was forced to. He got shot in the leg by a German soldier and was in a Nazi camp #QandA
@newscomauHQ @tanya_plibersek @QandA
Most Anzacs who returned from war chose to never speak of it. Why do those who weren't there think they have the right to market it? #qanda
Journalist historians... *giggles* #qanda
When a veteran speaks of sanitising our military history... One has to ask... All this glorification of #war. #QandA
@QandA listen to the soldier. He is the one who knows the truth. Vietnam was atrocious for everyone involved  #QandA
Unfortunately all countries or all persuasions "sanitise" their war record. #QandA
#QandA what about a new Moratorium Movement?
War historian defends themselves from an actual soldier. #AustraliaToday #qanda
Trust @QandA to get me back on Twitter - appalling the tweets of McIntyre. If I were head of SBS I'd be suggesting freelancing - forever
Thank heavens that regular people are finally getting over the ultra-jingoism of the Howard years. #qanda
There is still not adequate support for victims of war. It is heartbreaking that victims have to jump through hoops to get support. #qanda
@Qanda Only the British and Right-Wing LNP supporters should be sent to war! #Qanda
#QandA The true stories are preserved in letters and journals held by families.
The first thing my history lecturer at uni said was "question who wrote the text book" #qanda
Homeboy from Nam just schooled all y'all #qanda
And we play the game with bravery of being out of range #qanda #rogerwaters
Make peace not war @qanda
@QandA Anyone who thinks that ANZAC day glorifies war has obviously never been to a service
Imagine if there had been twitter at gallipoli. Might be a different narrative.  #qanda
if i was on this panel i'd be quoting from War &amp; Peace right now &amp; fucking blowing everyone's minds #qanda
I think @QandA should clarify latest #Bali9 news. Lawyer has told #Lateline appeal does not mean a stay of execution #qanda
#qanda and i don't have a job so suck that turnbill
100M for a statue in france? sorry Nepal. #thanksabbot #qanda
Get down to the War memorial Carolyn and open your eyes #qanda
@tomporteous Thank you for being the eloquent voice of reason on #qanda
Well said  - 2015 &amp; our government is still serving up liberal doses of 'war propoganda' #QandA
If you're having a good time on ANZAC DAY, because of it, you are doing it wrong. #QandA
War #twitterwordcloud #qanda
#Abbott #Anzac #QandA @QandA .... http://t.co/6qXLx6EeDP
What does "ANZAC" Spirit mean? If it means what people claim it means, our government must acknowledge the Armenian Genocide. #qanda
@QandA #QandA Scott McIntyre sparked controversy but in a non-derogatory manner, yet the derogatory Bolt &amp; Jones still keep their jobs!
If there is true feeling amongst this country that #AnzacDay has gone from  commeration to commercial, that's very  disappointing! #qanda
Hey academic, @mcintinhos was critical. #qanda
Woolworths capitalising on Anzac Day https://t.co/k6vicph6mR @qanda #qanda
#qanda Sen/Gen 'Pompey' Elliott ended up committing suicide in early '30's because politicians failed in there duty of care to the returned.
srsly governments go in to war for their own benefit and don't really consider citizens and the after effect #qanda
How about a relentless, constant two week focus on a peacetime spirit of sacrifice &amp; mateship?  That'd really celebrate our freedoms #qanda
Go Don Tate - Read 'Anzac Betrayed' #qanda
so much memory for those that were lost in WW's but never mention of how aboriginals feel remembering genocide #qanda
We should have a "weapons of mass destruction day" to remember the lie of Iraq #qanda
War - gosh - we should at least be able to criticise something so hideous, whether or not you think we need it #qanda
Kudos to #qanda soldier questioner. Now he's being answered by miss nitwit!
@catherine___c Tanya laid a wreath. But she showed her builder's cleavage. As she's a feminist, we should call it Hilda's cleavage. #qanda
It's hard to say anything about a war without experiencing it first hand. #qanda
#qanda there's too much money in war for it to stop
Facts are subversive and the line between fact and fiction is a blurry one. #qanda
How many horrifying things are happening in Saudi Arabia, Brunei, Egypt and other nations and we are silent? #qanda
In an ideal world the only spinning on ANZAC day should come from two pennies and a kip #QandA
#qanda   History just becomes "his-story"'
#QandA Our diggers would be turning in their graves if they saw the self promotion of ANZAC that went on by media companies.
When was #AnzacDay ever about glorifying war? It's about remembering what we've lost #QandA
#QandA @QandA It's not watching war films that perpetuates glorification, it is WHICH MOVIES you watch
#QandA for a reality check go to the war museum in Saigon
Another excellent question re sanitising the history of war #qanda. #auspol
Scrutiny, accountability, responsibility. If we don't 'celebrate' ANZAC day, then why such a rush to shelter it from these things? #qanda
Is ANZAC day with its praise of sacrifices, prayers and war memorials tricked out as temples, Australia's death cult? #qanda #auspol
Politicians should fight in their own wars #qanda
Seymour's play 'The one day of the year' needs a revival. #qanda
Censoring of military history is not unique to Australia. #qanda
Maybe SBS wanted to get rid of another reporter and #MacIntyre Anzac tweets gave them the excuse. @QandA
War! What isn't it good for? #qanda
History is written by the victor #QandA
.@kaubo's Lest We Forget What is a great doco that looks at real history around Anzac, it's on iview now. #qanda
@ecpkoko @Kyri_1 Dont know how you can watch that shit #QANDA is fucking rubbish
#qanda Australians can't take the moral high ground on Human Rights
Well said to the Vietnam veteran who wakes the public to the reality of war vs sanitised version told by politicians #qanda
#lessweforget #qanda
Thanks Menzies, Vietnam what a disgrace. #QandA
The ANZAC Spirit isn't about glorifying war - it's about sacrifice &amp; valiance #qanda
"Contaminated by nationalism" Unchecked nationalism is toxic #QandA
#qanda In twenty years time there WILL have been WMD in Iraq.  History will be rewritten!
Ethos of ANZAC should not be forgotten behind the glitterati of corporations. Never forget the sacrifices. #QandA
#qanda war is just death , there are no winners! #makepeacenotwar

@theheraldsun @QandA Very goid article. What can I say I don't believe in the death penalty &amp; I'm pretty sure these men are remorseful lets
#qanda what about acknowledgement of the frontier wars where indigenous australians were defending their country?
@QandA #qanda You don't build a war memorial and put up a list of atrocities your country committed.
#qanda  She's trying to sell her book!
#QandA The first War of the invasions of the British against the indigenous citizens of Australia is largely unrecognised. Change this!
Unable to QandA because pain, but drugs and chemical hot packs kicking in enough to retweet
Wow. Such honesty about the role of Gov in rewriting history #qanda
Pity about the sequel #QandA
People need to learn freedom of speech isnt freedom from consequence but freedom from prosecution #ScottMcIntyre #qanda

This nation was born in 1901, not 1915 #qanda
Has anyone seen a dead body on major TV networks caused by wars that we enter since the first Gulf War #qanda
#qanda All we do is invade countries in the name of protecting our freedom! Who is invading Australia ??? Why don't we mind our own business
Good question ....history is sanitized so how can we rely on the descriptions #qanda
@QandA We are all programed to be warriors, as a parent the best thing i can do for my son is make sure that his is an an honorable warrior
You know who doesn't glorify war? The people who fought in them. #QandA #AusPol @QandA
We would give our lives to protect family.Anzac and others protected the Australian family #QandA
Will Mr Tate, a Vietnam vet now get pilloried??  #QandA
#QandA Ah the truth, you can't handle the TRUTH! #QandA
@QandA the Folks at ABC are contrary, self-loathing, guilt ridden, oversocialised anti-australian talking headed nerds.
Not many of these wars has Australia had much of a choice, conscription has unofficially been a major factor. #qanda
why have i never had a tweet televised on #qanda. what the hell is this.
Holbrook needs a fucking reality check. She is revolting. #qanda
Well said Vietnam vet, media does promote nationalistic jingoism #qanda
#qanda https://t.co/JFjDDjpjSc
"How much faith can the Australian public have in military history?" Sanitised history? What of dead Aboriginal warriors? Genocide? #qanda
#AnzacFetish The fact that our soldiers who participated in the 'War On Terror' and in 'Vietnam' are still referred to as "diggers" #qanda
In modern history more #US soldiers die at their own hand from suicide due to #PTSD than on battlefield.   #qanda http://t.co/YzNHH5S6W0
Few Australians learn about Anzac Day from books, rather from stories told by parents and grandparents. #QandA
#qanda sanitised, corrupted and ignored, just ask the first Australians
#qanda just wondering if the government is as willing to spend on mental health of soldiers as a result of war as they are on fighting
Don Tate still fighting for our country. #qanda
Nationalism is the last refuge of a scoundrel #qanda
The first casualty of war is the truth #qanda
Soldiers coming home from serving overseas were not properly taken care of &amp; continue not to be. #qanda
@epistler1 @QandA @tomporteous and the executions of innocent people in the states at that!
The leaders should lead the charge #qanda
Anzac Day needs to open discussion on the *aftermath* of war which is so poorly understood, funded and supported. #QandA
#QandA  https://t.co/YePlEczaaG
Was it also not respectful for the ABC's Fact Checker to question many of the ANZAC legends? #QandA
i hope that Vietnam veteran doesn't work for SBS #qanda
Patriotism &amp; nationalism to labels &amp; categories to us &amp; them to separation &amp; division to anger &amp; hatred to violence &amp; War  #QandA
One point that needs to be said about #QandA is that it is amusing reading the names of some of the tweet handles on the tv screen!
And we're now planning to spend 100 million dollars to build -in France- yet another place to glorify war. What a waste! #qanda
Let's not forget the white feather that was given to men by women in order to shame them to go to war. #qanda
#qanda oh shut up Cheryl Holbrook.
#qanda We humans have a very shameful history built on almost constant conflict.  Not a very very intelligent species in my view.
Lest we forget? It's more important to remember The Old Lie: Dulce et Decorum Est #QandA
The Australian War Memorial is a memorial, not a museum. #qanda
#qanda I see ANZAC day more as a reminder of the horrors of war rather than a glorification of war.
Censorship of the truth in war is the real problem- the failures and sheer number of lives lost is not alway told  #QandA #ujcomm2657
@Qanda Arthur Sinodinus... What advice did you provide to AWH that was worth your $3million salary? #qanda
Manning Clark's history of Australia owes the nation's creation to a blood sacrifice; a vile position; political scientists reject #qanda
History is not Historiography.. #qanda
Anzac day hijacked by the RSL. All the veterans I ever knew thought they were an officer clique. Shunned vietnam conscripts for yrs. #QandA
If we didn't glorify war, how could we justify our attacks on Eastasia? #qanda

@10derTone  What is the ethos? @QandA
"History is written by the winners" - Orwell #qanda
glorification isn't my concern. "Happy ANZAC Day" posts &amp; complaints of no public holiday is evidence that education needs to happen #qanda
@adriannapc His employment contract would advise that his actions in a public sphere could impact on his employment if offensive . #qanda
Important for the history of war to be written by the soldiers involved. Honest. Painful. Complex. #qanda
The message is that the government needs war; or the threat thereof, to govern. #qanda
A lot of defensive answers coming after comments about the true crimes of war. #qanda
i came here to mute qanda and chew gum, and i'm all out of gum and also qanda is on
#QandA every warring side justifies war as a necessary evil.
MT @KM_Nicholson Lest we forget and lest we repeat #qanda
Good point about the sanitisation and censorship of Australian war history, do we as society forget what we want and romanticise war? #qanda
What a great deal nationalism has done for us... #Qanda
#qanda Enough with "Australian values"! I hate that phrase!
Let's give the politicians guns and let them sort things out. I'm sure we can find better solutions. Or at least have a rad tv show. #qanda
We're still at war now hey let's talk about that. #qanda
@QandA Reverently. Solemnly. Respectfully.
Blue jacket talks too much #qanda
History is never so much as true, as it is convoluted. #qanda
WW1, WW2, Vietnam ... Look what happens when MEN are in charge of our affairs. #qanda
You never hear about the women who were assaulted during war times. Lest we forget them. @QandA @qanda
Why aren't the Aussie WW1 battles in German Papua New Guinea ever discussed? #qanda

@QandA nice to hear someone say nationalism starts wars not religion
#QandA I could buy a dvd of tonight's Q&amp;A
Of course war is censored #qanda
Yes @tomporteous! You are speaking too much sense for the Australian media. Thanks for reminder how war is ugly on all sides. #qanda @qanda
History is always written by the victors.  #qanda
Tell Tony Abbott to stop saying Australia's heroes started in Gallipoli #qanda
ANZAC Day is in no way a glorification of war, rather a commemoration of loss. #qanda
CatherineHolbrook, niaive if she thinks the AustralianWarMemorial, &amp; government, isn't sanitising war. #qanda
My question is to the panel: do you think it's time you logged off? #qanda
We should just ask Mel Gibson he was there #qanda
Wait, you just wanted McIntyre sanitised. Maybe hold a consistent view for the whole show? #qanda
I think Australia's 'grand years' are overshadowed by cultural invasion of the first people. #qanda #ujcomm2657
'Australian values' - do whatever your government tells you to do? #qanda
Don's platoon was excised from official war histories due to atrocities #qanda
I hate the Vietnam war. But I sympathise with veterans given all they went through and had to put up with #qanda
#QandA Ataturk didn't write/say Johnnies &amp; Mehmets speech falsely attributed to him. Faith's for religion. History even #Anzac must be fact.
@tomporteous your an inspiration, you have done a great job on @QandA thank you for your educated comments and your calm way do deliver.
The documentation on the invasion of Darwin during WWll was totally secreted away. We know very little about it. #qanda
The myth that "Australia was born at Gallipoli" is one of the most abhorrent ideas possible. #Qanda
We've lost too many links to our history as a nation to trust the narrative of the ANZACs #qanda
Such true comments from a vet. Stop fiding the truth to make war more palatible to the public #qanda
Only the ABC will criticise Anzac Day!! Traitors! #qanda
Sentiment and nationalism shouldn't override the reality that was and is war. #ujcomm2657 #qanda
So grateful for this vet on #qanda Using this stage to confirm our increasing feelings of disconnection with "history"
#qanda Why don't we have a peace memorial?
Jansant @Jansant 13 minutes ago  How can there be free speech if free speaking threatens your job? #QandA
The truth of war is a horror for only the soldier. @qanda

A #QandA haiku: More than half way through Important discussion yet no climate mention #ujcomm2657 @QandA #auspol
So what's offensive? Kids on the First Nation soldiers memorial or #ScottMcIntyre tweets  #qanda http://t.co/agQWw1y9Sr
The ANZAC legend was based in the Bush myth itself. A construct that is seen as defining us as a nation- reductionist &amp; exclusionary. #qanda
It appears that much of Australia's history is more about legend than truth and fact. #qanda
We have a political (ruling) class in Australia? No way, mate. The guys in charge assure me it isn't so.   #qanda

"A nation was born". Please explain this phrase, it genuinely makes no sense. #qanda
@QandA war journalists USED to report from the battlefield, NOW they report what the Military tells them to report from the comfort of hotel
No veteran ever glorifies war. Those that do typically have never experienced it #qanda
Charles Bean did a decent job on Anzac history but like many historians fell into trap of myth making through storytelling. #qanda
#qanda I see no breaking news coming from Indonesia?
YES! Great point - history is written &amp; rewritten by the powerful for their own purposes #QandA
My question for the panel is: why does everyone hate jazz hands? #qanda

We have enough trouble agreeing about what's going on right now, let alone a history many of us can't imagine. #qanda #ujcomm2657
Politicians should stay out of the Anzac Day memorials #qanda http://t.co/VO6pxjedXP
Thank you Vietnam vet for your service. #lestweforget #qanda
Let's have dead bodies in the war museums and see how we think about war. #qanda
#QandA Isn't it strange that with all the Anzac commems, there was almost NO attention on the Armenian Genocide-the massacre of 1.5m people?
.@Wendy_Bacon @QandA war commemoration done properly would mainly consist of recital of all such horror; the heroics far outweighed by waste
It's a shame there are no WW1 vets left to tell it like it is. The lefties waited for them to die out. #qanda

Remember that our history curriculum is an ideological minefield. #QandA
I'd love to know the effect of having female front-line troops may have on war crimes. #QandA
War isn't "sanitised" in Australian schools. Children are taught to go to primary sources such as veterans' accounts #qanda
The more you dig, the more you see the Anzac legends are not worth the T Shirt they are written on. #qanda
War doesn't create the characteristics of the nation, it reveals them. #QandA
Australia was founded on the blood, stolen lives, stolen wages and stolen children of First Nations people, not in Gallipoli #qanda
Let's not underestimate some of the truely amazing achievements of the ANZACs, albeit terrible actions. #qanda
When are governments going to actually support returned vets ? #qanda
Shell Shock, Battle Fatigue, Operational Exhaustion, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder - Soft language #QandA
Just as the US covered up the truth about deaths by 'friendly' fire. #qanda
#qanda Vietnam needs to be declassified...acknowledge ALL who fought in Vietnam
@QandA Firstly anyone who think Anzac Day is about glorifying the war is fool. Secondly when are going to talk about building a star ship.
Sentimentality in politics is dangerous. #QandA
@QandA Would overseas-born citizens w/o familial historical attachment to ANZAC  be considered less Australian? #qanda
People trust words more than experiences. Why don't we combine the two? #qanda
Liberal governments have an unfortunate habit of joining illegal and unjustifiable wars #QandA
Can we move on to @tanya_plibersek and her policies announced today regarding gay marriage? #qanda #marriagequality
The power of omission! Shame, shame, shame. #qanda
Mine is fine. #qanda Broad views ok https://t.co/iBOobbqLja
A Vietnam vet telling of sanitising of war history - experience speaks the truth #qanda
Remember that history is always written by the winners. #QandA
Post-globalised, post #TPP "values" will see wars fought for Nation-States that no longer have power to legislate in public interest #qanda
holy shit. really feel for this Vietnam vet. #QandA
#QandA   The fraud is not the returned soldier but the sentimentalists and dogmatists
The idea that "Australia was born at Gallipoli" is one of the most abhorrent myths possible. #Qanda
Historians are always worse than people who were actually there... #qanda
Does the least generous  #AustralianAid budget in our history rub against the Australia you want? #qanda Then please http://t.co/69mI6eqjVV
.@oneplanetmikey No. And it's not supposed to. #qanda #auspol http://t.co/l2iHZiKcBY
@QandA Nice to hear the absolute real truth from a man involved
I cannot begin to imagine the hurt that the erasing of your history would have. #QandA
I'm so sorry! To all Viet vets. We should all be sorry! #QandA
These are not sovereign issues Tim Fisher, Indonesia has signed international laws, that creates global accountability @QandA #qanda
There is still not adequate support for victims of war. It is heartbreaking that victims have to jump through hoops to get support. #qanda
Oh, missed #qanda again.
glorification isn't my concern. "Happy ANZAC Day" posts &amp; complaints of no public holiday is evidence that education needs to happen #qanda
What's the pin on Sinodinos' jacket? #QandA
#QandA Musta been undercover. We'll have a lot more of this.
These people fought the 'Great War' and others so there would be no more. End of story. #qanda
Australia would be a significantly different nation today had the Anzacs landed at a different beach. #QandA
Is no such thing as unique Australian values. Or any other nation. There are just universal humanistic values we all share. #qanda
#qanda Can we stop calling journalists historians? They're nothing of the sort.
does ANYONE realise that the aboriginals demonstrate our values 50,000 years ago #qanda
@SigmundMarx so it's not terrorism because muslim people did not execute the bombs in japan ?! please shut up. #qanda @qanda
The ADF toil away in many other areas beside war zones. Target the pollies who move this vunerable group around like 'pawns'! #QandA
War historians cannot possibly tell the whole story. Only parts of it. #QandA
You're a champion, Don. #qanda
Arthur Sinodinos? About as much credibility as Mark Latham. #ICAC #qanda
Tom Is right The danger is This honouring of War is being used by The Polit classes 2 obscure The Horrors the reasons why we went2War #qanda
#QandA is this program a platform for dons cause
Wow! #qanda
Disgusting behaviour by the War Memorial. #QandA #AusPol @QandA
Governments don't care about soldiers @QandA #QandA
Values borne in the trenches? Like regret, fear, hopelessness, carnage? #qanda
Watching #qanda I can only wish that the country listened to our scientists, humanitarian workers, etc rather than establishment WASP males.
Australian culture hasn't changed since early 19thC. Racist during the gold rush, racist today @QandA #QandA
The only person speaking on on this subject with certainty is Don our Vietnam Vet. The rest is supposition #qanda
All the funerals I've been too have been sanitised #qanda
@main_man @QandA #qanda do you think the public could handle hearing all the ins and outs of war at the frontline of any war
War is not hell who goes to hell father bad people are civillians bad people no hawkeye war is a failure of deplomacy #qanda mash quote
Arthur is looking a bit uncomfortable... #qanda
Does this sounds a bit Jacob's Ladder? #qanda
Very sad story Don #qanda
This. This is what war does to those who fight in it. #qanda
#qanda Children today have a far greater understanding and appreciation of sacrifices of war than we ever did.
Good comment on #war #history and #revisionism - #ANZAC @QandA #QandA #LNP #ALP
@MapleLeafAussie in a war that wasn't ours to fight... We lost more people per capita than any other country... And for what? #QandA
#qanda  the pending court challenge won't stop executions. Latest update
Wow! Cannot imagine how frustrated this man must be!! #qanda
This Vietnam vet is ripping the government's treatment of histroy to shreds. It's awesome. #qanda
Awesome #qanda is ticking off all the issue of the day. So we can expect climate change to be next. Rightio then.
Governments lying and rewriting history? Never! #qanda
Why don't we hear about Vietnam? Because it's too fresh in the memory to sanitise #qanda
Julian Assange can get us those documents surely?! #QandA
Denied the right of recognition. Shame on the Aus War memorial @QandA #QandA
Stop spending money on war commemorations -spend it on mental and physical health for Vets instead  #qanda
Arfur knows all about scrubbing the record. #qanda
This is so interesting, knowledge is power #qanda
#qanda Yes of course they are!
Again, this stinks of Jebediah Springfield #QandA
@newscomauHQ @tomporteous @QandA I didn't think anyone isn't aware that war is hell.
That poor war veteran. #QandA
Vietnam? What's that? #Qanda
Pay attention again to the vet, defence hides stuff #qanda
WWI poets were eyewitnesses. Read Siegfried Sassoon, Wilfred Owen. They tell it as they lived it. Horrifying. ANZAC Day = awareness. #QandA
@godwingrech I We need 2 have discussion in Aus about empires real reasons 4 Gallipoli landing It was meant to fail History #qanda #auspol
Don Bradman was a Nazi sympathiser #qanda
What an insult to this brave man. Anyone who serves should be recognised. #qanda
Claims about the AWM on #qanda are verifiably false. They are on of the most open public institutions in Australia.
PTSD is rife amongst returning soldiers and they're not given the support they need, particularly monetary support. #qanda
No one wins a war #QandA
I don't remember him. What unit was Don in? #qanda
war is nothing more than an industry of lies propaganda murder and genocide for colonial interests theres nothing GOOD about ANZAC #Qanda
What a disgrace! This is disgusting!! #qanda
#qanda part of the story http://t.co/k6nvotfTxT
@ellinjaa Pearl Harbour? Darwin? #qanda
I can't help feeling that it's a long bow to draw to say that our freedom is due to the needless sacrifice of Anzac soldiers #qanda
@RitaPanahi funny, since it seems to be mostly conservative commentators I see tweeting about #qanda
People asking questions always seem to make better panel guests #qanda
Lol I've been trying to get on #qanda (some boring tv show) for the past 20 mins. Got put on with a topic about call of duty! ;)
FEDERAL ICAC NOW!! #FEDERALICACNOW #qanda #auspol @qanda http://t.co/Ns17IhDI12
#qanda How long do we need to hang onto things? No one is alive today that was at Anzac cove in 1915. Who is remembering?
History is written by the victors...who went to university and read books rather than experiencing it @QandA
This was NOT terrorism! @qanda #qanda #Dresden #Churchill #ScottMcIntrye http://t.co/cwIbnk33ad
It may not be glamorous, but there was an Australian identity prior to Gallipoli based on democracy, Federation, and so on #QandA
Whenever I hear factual numbers of the deaths during war time - I am reminded why I support peace #qanda
We don't know what really goes on.  #qanda
The facts of our wars need to be told with utter honesty. No censorship. No creative license. #QandA
@QandA I see ANZAC day more as a reminder of the horrors of war rather than a glorification of war.
The #Anzac soldiers were ripped off by Aust and UK governments - they were sent on a futile campaign. #qanda
The sad thing is, this Veteran would not be the only one whose records are sanitisation, I'm sure there are many more!!! #QandA
Very valuable hearing the stories of veterans, go and ask about them if you can #qanda
@QandA to the veteran in the Vietnam War. Thank u for ur service. Wht a shame it is tht nationalism is tainting &amp; cleaning the truths of war
Well if this is true. This is just disgraceful ! #qanda
#QandA no wonder so many current serving members are taking their own lives with public statements like these.
@Larnie_R @QandA I think we are adult enough to hear the good and bad
Bike lanes should be 3 metres wide so I can put a wider basket on my bike for when I go to the op shop. #qanda
IA contributor Don Tate speaking about the sanitisation of war history on #qanda . His bio here: https://t.co/W9v8OvVKSx
War sanitisation: It's nothing new, Charles Bean was the official war historian back in 1919. @QandA #QandA
It's called Revisionist history #qanda
God Bless #QandA literally the best thing ever
War records should be transparent #qanda
How can the commemoration of LOSS be the glorification of war? #auspol #qanda
War sanitised? Nooooooo. #qanda
Please expound on justification of our latest foray in Middle East panel in this context @qanda #qanda
A royal commission into the Australian War Memorial #qanda
#qanda Many platoons of Vietnam still 'don't exist'
Quintessential Australian value, making immigration more difficult, first act of federation  #qanda
I've little doubt those who fell at ANZAC &amp; its Veterans would, if they could be glad that we're debating why we celebrate ANZAC day. #QandA
If we are all proud of war, why hide things? #qanda
@QandA glorification isn't my concern. "Happy ANZAC Day" posts &amp; complaints of no public holiday is evidence that education needs to happen
What a horrible experience to be excluded after the hell of war #QandA
Maybe we need a judicial inquiry as to why these war records are being withheld #QandA
War is sanitised to protect the common people's ignorance. @qanda @QandA
My view of war has always been shaped by stories told by my high school's AV guy who was conscripted. And none of them were good. #qanda
Let's talk about the media hyping up "5 NRL matches on ANZAC day" shall we? #qanda
First freedom of speech, now 'sanitizing' the truth.. Interesting episode #qanda
Ask the soldiers then. #qanda
The main point here is war is futile... No matter the rhetoric the political world wants to feed us! #QandA
@QandA the whole ANZAC experience needs rebranding. Why don't we talk more about peace as opposed war! Keep your eyes on the prize!
Sanitisationgate #qanda
Don't forget the frontier wars where aboriginal people were massacred. #qanda
@annabelcrabb @QandA Please explain what that term means Lets not have wordogoly here
The War Memorial has just been side-swiped there #qanda
I thought historians were part of the leftist academic conspiracy? #qanda
Records of war are sanitized .... We just get the history we want to hear it seems #qanda
@theheraldsun @QandA better for them &amp; other prisoners that they serve life in jail &amp; continue to helo/rehabilitate other prisoners. I pray
.@ChrisCourtney4 @Wendy_Bacon @QandA yes they did; you are the one they'd treat w/contempt
#qanda more Aussie kids know about ANZACs then English kids know about WW1 #keepremembering
Tim Fischer is looking very sad &amp; concerned over the Vietnam vets story of military lies #qanda
@ch_nese qanda q eh
Good to see sanitisation of war records being addressed publicly #QandA
Bloody hell, why would these records be suppressed? #qanda
@domagoj_bosnjak @QandA EXACTLY. its bs.  i actual can't handle it anymore.
History is full of lies. No one really knows the truth. #qanda
@tomporteous your an inspiration, you have done a great job on #qanda thank you for your educated comments and your calm way do deliver.
#qanda follow @destroy_robots and @We_Love_Aural on the online
Should have a look at today's Japanese school curriculum on WW2 #qanda
@MarianRakosi @tanya_plibersek @JB_AU @QandA You would have to say she has not been outstanding as Shadow FM.
Terrible to conscript someone to fight someone else's war then airbrush them out of history. #qanda
it's UnAustralian to have a property auction, but it's ok to get pissed and go to a footy match!? #qanda #openTheShops
Move on please, we've just talked about war more than any other topic so far tonight #qanda
It's desperately sad but Indonesia is sovereign country, we have limited leverage in saving the #Bali9 no political will in Indo #qanda
40 years on and Vietnam veterans are still being cheated. #qanda
@60Mins last night and now this do show how history is sanitised #qanda
#QandA Holbrook making a hypocrite of herself. Criticising blind nationalism in military history  after being critical of McIntyre's tweets.
Of course history is sanitised. History written by the victors mentality. #qanda
Australian sanitisation of war records makes us no different to the propaganda of Nazi Germany during WWII that we all condemned. #QandA
"History is written by the victors" Churchill #qanda
We should question war but not the dedication of soldiers who genuinely did their best, under orders, to defend their country. #qanda
#qanda We are told lies that we landed on the wrong beach !! There is proof that it was the right location !!
Where is our commemoration of the thousands of Indigenous people killed when Australia was invaded? Why only honour white soldiers? #QandA
government not always tell the truth mak u think #qanda
So... Anyone up for a revival of The One Day of the Year? @SydneyTheatreCo? @JaneCaro #qanda
One of those thing that you know happens but when you hear it calmly spoken about... #qanda
Another thing $inodeni$ is unaware of Hes very poor at his job #qanda
What I saw on Anzac Day was service men and women with dignity and young civilians with none #qanda
My Uncle Bob fought in Kokoda and spent the last years of his life educating the public about his first hand experience in war #qanda
All Governments sensor information from their citizens #qanda
history will remain bias for as long as humans write it #QandA
Oh look, we're a "free society" again #qanda
Anzac has been manipulated for WASP  interests and people sucked in. #QandA
#qanda why are historical facts of war being sanitised?
Arthur, mate, which rock have u been living under? #qanda
History is always written by the victors to reflect the required propaganda #QandA
Of course all wars are sanitised in their reporting and recollection. Unless you fought in them. #qanda
You can't re-fight the history wars with only one historian on the panel #qanda
History is always told by the 'winners' #qanda
@QandA These people fought the 'Great War' and others so there would be no more. End of story. #qanda
I want to let rip on #QandA but I might be fired.
The Australian War Memorial still has statues of Aborigines amongst the 'Fauna' if Australia- #qanda
There were a lot of undercover ops which didn't get mentioned. Take the massacre in Laos from Vietnam #QandA
The hijacking of ANZAC day by Jingo inspired political spin doctors to exploit xenophobia for political dominance is dishonourable #QandA
This isn't the only example of an attempt to erase or alter history #qanda
Good on Don. No hiding it now. #qanda
Are the wars we fight sanitised? Are we lied to because we only choose the "victories" that suit our 'narratives'? #qanda
A Service Record needs to be accurate  #qanda
#qanda politicians only pretend to give a shit when confronted on camera. How nice you finally have time!
Watching Tony mansplaining to the blokes was fun! #QandA
#qanda you can't have a different perspective on war or you get the sack
Can we just send politicians to fight their own fucking wars and leave the common person alone? There'd be more peace everywhere. #qanda
What are they hiding? Maybe we can hear about it in a new TV show airing next Anzac Day $$$  #QandA
Historians should interpret the data, not EDIT the data #QandA
#qanda real soldiers suffer because reality doesn't fit the fantasy narrative of #ANZAC
#qanda Government can't tell the truth otherwise no one will line up to play with their guns and spill their blood for a vague idea
is anzac day being used as a tool to aid nationalist fever? #qanda
We often seem to focus on the glittering moments, sweeping the moments we're less proud of under the rug. #qanda
War memorials tend to skew reality @QandA #QandA
We need to hear more from these people!! Hear THEIR stories. Document them. Tired of #Jingoism http://t.co/KWTSc41FYd #QandA @QandA #ANZAC
@QandA #ArthurSinodinos Fixing buildings in #NepalEarthquake ? Mate! How about be starting by saving human life.
#qanda Historical revisionism is a fact, especially when is discredits the country affected.
History can bend with the wind but truth is truth #qanda
The Australian War Memorial also denies that the Frontier Wars happened. That's the biggest sanitisation of war. @QandA #qanda
Official history has always been sanitised. Who would edit Ceaser? #qanda
I believe that Vietnam Vet #qanda
#qanda Release the records regarding HMAS Sydney. What really happened?
#qanda All Australian history is sanitised. Google Mister Oceanic. Nothing. Even Google is controlled here.
Amazing how history can flesh out as opinion rather than fact #QandA
History 101 - "What is BIAS?" #qanda
@QandA are you kidding Arthur, things can get lost?
#QandA Mmmm seams like the new METADATA laws may be tested if the media do some research on the War Memorial people
Brendan Nelson who spoke that abysmal response to the apology? Wonderful! Thanks Arthur! #qanda
#qanda  pity our  leaders of information when terrorist propaganda by our leaders of and merciless murder of aboriginals in frontier wars
this guy is like the Damir Dokic of War Memorials #qanda
We're taking about source documents, not opinion pieces #QandA
Soldiers fight wars so we don't have to, but that shouldn't mean that we should be completely shielded from it. #qanda
Things may get "lost"? Just like your memory Mr "I cannot recall"? #QandA
Can't sell houses but definitely run ads and make few $$$ - spirit of ANZAC day is now used for political agendas #qanda
#QandA suggests keep Tweets clean! DONT FUCK WITH MY FREEDOM OF SPEECH @QandA !! #justkidding it's your choice what you publish!!
Isn't it write what you KNOW, not write from your PERSPECTIVE? #qanda
#qanda @QandA where does foreign aid end, we have our own internal problems!
Censorship at its finest #qanda
That is a cop out Arthur, he is talking about documentation. Pretty hard for there to differences of opinion. #qanda
@ToniBlackmore @QandA I mean he's the third person that gets to speak tonight.
'Perspectives' and 'freedom of speech' is not an excuse for writing veterans out of history #qanda
Australia has always exaggerated success and denied failures in wars. #QandA
Can the panel please expound on our latest foray in Middle East in the context of this discussion @qanda #qanda
People like #ScottMcIntyre have to be purged from media for not towing the lie @LiberalEffects http://t.co/lMqUXLfYkD #ABCmediawatch #qanda
There is only ever one version of the truth. Unfortunately that version is hardly ever the one officially on record. #QandA
Challenging conventional wisdom about the history of modern wars : http://t.co/kxMMdT6E50 #qanda
Historians like economists always have a political bias #qanda
Before you tweet in a political or media context, think where your career will end up if you're lynched off Twitter. #qanda
We n end to hear about the horrors of war from thos who caught it #qanda
Would love to be watching QandA right now but I'm on Twitter even though I should be studying for an exam in the AM! #priorities
Oh I dunno - sounds like a conspiracy to me! #qanda
#qanda historians need records to interpret, if they are not available it's not the historians fault
CEW Bean was a war historian, and he was there. #QandA
#qanda gets me so revved up
This is why it is important to teach students critical thinking skills and about perspective #qanda
Be interested to see if this is actually followed through lol #QandA
Lost or buried! Disgusting #qanda
#qanda Tim Fischer's Aussie values = cushy $4.3 mil taxpayer paid stay at Vatican plus kickbacks #AWB #auspol
How about you trust the guy who nearly lost his life, instead of your own bias!!! #qanda
Those making the ultimate sacrifice did so we could criticise them in todays society? The one they saved for us? #respect #ujcomm2657 #QandA
It's a pity Arthur Sinodinos is no longer in parliament he is a talent wasted #qanda
War is declared and written by the parties that have the most to win. The truth gets in the way of victory #qanda
#qanda  records also do not recognise that engineers were the first to land at Gallipoli before the artillery.
WW1 was supposed to be over by xmas 1914. It was sold as an adventure. It became a matter of survival and looking after each other #qanda
Recent events show you don't need a conspiracy. Just groupthink #qanda
@QandA  #qanda Free society eh McIntrye gets the sack!!!
Nice cut-off of an actual returned serviceman there Tony @QandA  Prefer to let the uninformed talk? #QandA
#qanda the sanitisation continues. Tell us about some recent casualties that go unreported.
Imagine if Anzac day hoopla was a massive political exercise to drum up right wing votes #qanda
We have secrets. Some things will never surface. #qanda
Bullshit #qanda a soldier was there not a bloody historian
Let's all trust Sinodinos! What could go wrong #qanda
is history sanitsied? its wholly constructed.. #qanda
@QandA #QandA Historians wrote large portions of the bible. What does this say for modern religion?
If things were lost why did the Government need a solicitor to tell us about it? #QandA #AusPol @QandA
On Anzac Day I despair for the futility of war, I celebrate my birthday and I remember my first and endless love #qanda
History has never been an account of facts. #QandA
#qanda Utter crap...nothing in Vietnam was lost. It has ALL been withheld
#qanda "Different perspectives" are not the same thing as deliberate sanitisation of war, Arthur!
What was the motive for erasing a battalion from AWM records? #qanda
#qanda Remember when Brandis said that everyone has the right to be a bigot. So the left seem to agree with George now. #hypocrites
War is brutal, smelly, disgusting, violent and ugly, no one wants to show that, that is why we keep having them #qanda
The vilest desecration of the ANZACs' memories is the continued existence of war. Not what some journo tweeted. #qanda
Shock horror - 100 years after WWI and sanitisation of historical evidence is uncovered only today...! #qanda
Go to any funeral and watch selective history be written.  #qanda
More soldiers should speak about war, less Spin Doctors  #qanda
Veronica Glenguntly returning from the Big Gig days and pops up on #qanda
@QandA #qanda Sinodinos isn't worth two bob #auspol
This nation's obsession with the ANZACs is part of the whitewashing of Australian history, to overshadow and forget the Frontier Wars #qanda
Yes, Arthur, the War Memorial accidentally hired a lawyer. #Qanda
#qanda, ANZAC day we respect the men and women who fought for freedom.This day is not one to be posting disrespectful commentary true or not
It does not take 38 years to fix a stuff up does it? #qanda
Surely the Frontier Wars and our genocide of ATSI people right here is more defining of this country than the ANZACs in Gallipoli? #qanda
Of course, war also causes psychological problems, doesn't it? #qanda
Freedom of information in national security is not an Australian forte #qanda
Interesting hearing from the likes of Don Wood #QandA
Very disappointing to here that a veteran is being accused of lying. #respectourvets #qanda
@QandA free society maybe but the truth is the truth
Sanitising war = army ads #qanda
How can one veteran possibly have an accurate view of a whole war? #qanda
Exactly, "the winners write the history" #qanda
Historians create narratives around events, using recounts from people who were there. That's their job. #qanda
ALL Borrowed money much Borrowed from the Rich &amp; Governments of the countries we were giving aid to #qanda  https://t.co/HKyw8ncOKq
A Vietnam veteran reminding us of the ugly side of military history. So much for Lest We Forget #QandA

Where's the Royal Commissions investigating these decisions to go to war/join conflict? #QandA
If we are glorifying war, why are we censoring it? #qanda
Sinodinos is not telling the truth - surprise #qanda
Oh looky an ex Liberal politician in charge of the War Memorial. Any wonder history is being censored &amp; white washed?! #propaganda #qanda
History. His. Story. Many stories, yet very few are told. Even Arthur Sinodinas states "things can get lost, in inverted commas" #qanda
In the war museum in Vietnam it's called the "American" war. #qanda
Total respect for the ex digger posing the question on #qanda
Finally someone cutting through the chatter, clutter and rhetoric of the language surrounding ANZAC day. @QandA #carolynholbrook
@QandA How on earth can it be a 'perspective' when the guy who was actually there is sitting in the audience?
@QandA Tanya looks more like a PM than Tony whatshisname or that other guy
There is also a place for oral history #qanda @QandA
#qanda is anyone going to ask the VET why the records were sanitised?
WAR, Uh, good god. Aah, what is it good for? Absolutely nuthin'. #qanda
"Are elements of the wars we fight in sanitized?" LOL Naive you are. #qanda
one man's stuff up is another's conspiracy theory #qanda
Roll call over on G+ #qanda #ujcomm2657
History is only ever written by the politicians who succeed o power in the winning nations #QandA
Neither historians nor veterans have absolute claim to truth about war. Historians weren't there, and veterans only saw a snapshot #QandA
#qanda  We honour teens in war brainwashed by foreign ideology in 1915. Same action in 2015 is criminalised.
Official war history is always sanitised. To protect the guilty. #QandA
a Big question here is.. TONY.. Why are you missing the main point with Arthur on the Panel? Maybe the ABC should Hire your wife... #qanda
@annabelcrabb @QandA Sinodinos must have been digging through the thesaurus preshow looking for ways to frame his comeback to the frontbench
It took over over 50yrs for my father to tell his kids about his experience of war such was its effect on him. #QandA
The cost of war continues long after returning home #qanda
History is like gossip. It's gets distorted over time &amp; distance. #qanda
Its not a big question. The answer is yes. Some stuff is sanitized because it doesnt match the stuff you get on commemorative coins #qanda
History is too often a case of Chinese whispers.  #QandA
#qanda Let's be honest. All aspects of Australia's history are clouded at best.
Truth is the first casualty of war #qanda
I'm sick to death of the rewriting of the ANZAC "legend" by jingoistic idiots. Proof that culture and history are dumbed down #qanda
This isn't about historians opinions, its about facts. #qanda
As Tolstoy opined, war what is it good for? #qanda
#QandA it's not all about you Don
War is censored and sanitised #QandA
@qanda Where is the truth about the long bombing if Darwin?
So the way to get action on something is to get into #qanda audience and catch a pollie unawares. Got it. #qanda
Real eyes realise real lies. #qanda
As the #ANZACs were landing the #Assyrian genocide was taking place. Should this genocide be recognized as part of our history? #QandA
Tanya Plibersek for PM! Brillant communicator. Does not eat onions, raw. #qanda
War kills. War traumatizes men. And women. It's as simple as that. #QandA

Australia - your next challenge is to turn the underarm bowl into a crowning sporting achivement #qanda

I haven't heard of this sanitisation of War ...Really $Arthur$ #qanda
They've been airbrushing war history since Bean. How could anyone not know this? #qanda
@QandA #war #history #story http://t.co/WTgfnE79Wc
#qanda great question from an ex Vietnam vet questioning the role of media &amp; govt in the war myth &amp; sanitizing #auspol  #nationalism
@QandA realise you have a high immigrant population for whom the spirit of Anzac is either irrelevant or un-understandable
#QandA Stuff up rather than conspiracy - for decades. Just disgusting
@akayanni @QandA Yeah! That'll work.
#qanda #FreeRecharge Heyy friends!! Start earning free talktime daily with Mojo app. http://t.co/2Xylk8goYA
HSC History extension students have looked at representations of ANZAC and war for years. Discussion is a bit behind! #qanda
so Tonight QandA is talking about glorifying war sound like we got some Anti-Australia people in the crowd
Story... alleged... lots of careful language tonight #qanda
@MikeKellyofEM made an honourable mention on #QandA tonight. Let's just remember his achievements in 2016 #EdenMonaro
#Qanda Dr Brendan Nelson is quite a reasonable chap. I'm sure he'd be willing and ready to help this gentleman.
History is much more palette-able when it's sanitised #qanda
#qanda Don't forget the embedded journos through the gulf war.... controlled access ??
Thanks Tanya! Someone FINALLY mentions Aboriginal soldiers! #qanda
Criminals have received far less for rape and murder in our own backyard and nobody has meddled with local legal process #qanda
@annabelcrabb @QandA Perhaps 'jazz hands' a la Miranda Devine would be more appropriate, Annabel?
You'd be a fool if you thought war documents aren't censored. #qanda
@rhysam and the ones that are poorly read probably aren't reading Twitter #qanda
All Governments censor information from their citizens #qanda
Returned vets suicides are censored. #ptsd #qanda
Only those who were there know the truth and reality of war #QandA
you dont remember and celebrate thousands of men being slaughtered. it's supposed to be solumn not a day for piss and gambling #qanda
War benefits the arms industry, the petrochemical corporations and rich shareholders. It never benefits the people. War is a lie #qanda
Governments sanitising Wars they fight in. Victors writing the history of Wars. God forbid. #qanda
Are we learning from our war history after sanitisation of so called war history #qanda
Hate "Birth of the Nation" talk. Downplays those that went before and after. Simplistic, jingoistic narrative championed by Howard #qanda
The women have been totally forgotten in ANZAC commemorations #qanda
If war wasn't censored, who would sign up? #qanda
@QandA #QandA time for war to be studied by anthropologists not historians
Who is prepared to take a cut locally so our foreign aid can be increased?  #someoneelse #qanda
@Qanda Truth is the first casualty #qanda
Aboriginal men enlisted as Maoris. Sacrificing even identity for country. #qanda
The damage when soliders return is sorely missing from this discussion #QandA
It is important for people to tell their stories &amp; be heard. #qanda
We've got a few Vietnam vets here in the retirement village. None of them like to talk about war very much. Silence speaks volumes. #qanda
#qanda check update on latest on #Bali9
If conscription today many Australians wouldn't have a bar of ANZAC DAY #QandA
Maybe Sinodinus will get a focus group to tell him how to react to sanitising of war history #qanda
Only the dead see the end of war #qanda
Listen to Roger Waters' (ex Pink Floyd) 'Amused to Death'. And Pink Floyd's 'The Final Cut' #qanda https://t.co/GgPTucMPRi
And there it is.....#blackdiggers #QandA
Covert War in Laos. #qanda
I can never understand the countless people who don't have their war record acknowledged. #QandA
We never seem to mention the British influence on our military history in this context. Is this the elephant in the room? #qanda
We don't celebrate on ANZAC Day. It's a day of commemoration. #qanda
Bill Shorten, I hope you're watching Tanya Plibersek on #QandA tonight. This is how you gravitas.
No one talks about the way the Germans were treated post war...HORRIFIC! Thousands died of starvation alone #qanda
In war, truth belongs to the victors. Not the vanquished!! #QandA
"You can't handle the truth" #qanda
If Gallipoli happened today we wouldn't hear about it because of government censorship  #qanda
If people knew about the real atrocities that occur during war, people's perception of ANZAC day/ect would be different. #ujcomm2657 #qanda
@seanjelinek  Lest we keep forgetting! #QandA http://t.co/xebxn1sObl
#QandA Some truth can be embarrassing, especially for Politicians..
say what you want about ANZAC Day, but at least we don't say "thank you for your service" to every single soldier like in the US. #QandA
@benpobjie does anyone remember the WMDs in Iraq? or have they been forgotten too? #QandA
If the public knew the truths of war, no one would sign up #qanda
Pray for those less fortunate. (Prayers are cheap!) #qanda
Just remember kids, Orwell was right, war is peace #qanda
Tanya and Tom win #qanda tonight.
On a scale of 1 to North Korea, how sanitised are our war records? #qanda
#qanda war - if it was sanitised no one would do it.
Thanks for your service mate #qanda
@tanya_plibersek Thank you for mentioning aboriginal diggers @QandA #QandA
Hope Sinodinos writes that questioner's sanitisation claims down , otherwise he won't recall it #qanda
It's not uncommon for war facts to be distorted or "lost" . It's actually, both, terribly sad and disturbing #qanda
Conspiracy in the Defence Department. What rubbish. #qanda
#QandA I trust the government. Doesn't everyone?
#qanda excellent brush down of ANZAC mythology. Herbert Asquith needed his lover's approval for the Gallipolli debacle.
perhaps it's sanitized coz ~collateral damage~ #qanda
#qanda free society  pfft  Australia does not even aknowledge The Forgotten War read Ken Renyolds. 100yr war against  aboriginals
Jumbo pack of war sanitisers being distributed by Arthur Sinodinous right now. #qanda
@QandA War journalists reporting mass crimes in Vietnam war by US troops were met with Ant-American jibes &amp; Threats
History is constantly rewritten and slanted by historians with agendas and PhD candidates looking for a unique angle. #qanda
We can and should do more for #Nepal #qanda
I can't believe what I'm watching on Q&amp;A! War veterans should be telling the story, not pen pushing historians! #QandA
War is censored at the peril of our young. #qanda
#QandA perhaps Tim Fischer should have stayed home to watch QandA and tweet. His seat would have been used by someone else
Unbelievable that soldiers continue to be "forgotten" and their stories sanitised. For shame, Australian bureaucracy #QandA
Conversations with parents &amp; grandparents who lived through WWII paint a very different picture for me than the official line... #QandA
Aboriginal veterans have spent years being ostracized from ANZAC commemorations #qanda
Anzac Day is not a celebration. It's an observance. A day of atonement remembering the dead. Lest we forget @QandA
Is it any coincidence that the revival of the #ANZAC spirit corresponds with the rise of a foreigner-fearing nationalist movement? #qanda
#QandA I think he would know if he was in the war. Government needs to fix this
Another question for the #qanda panel: is there anyone who can do my coursework for me. Where do I find such a person
Did World War 1 kill off much of the optimism and egalitarian spirit in Australia after Federation and before 1914? #qanda
@qanda ANZAC Day is not a celebration, its a day of remembrance! #Qanda
We need more real stories documented of our Veterans! Not just the "hero" stories they have in books by historians! #QandA
Why are so many returning diggers given such a raw deal by their government? #qanda
Lets not forget our most "effective" national war - genocide of the original Tasmanians. #qanda
Sen. Sin talking about "sanitising" documents and information, his specialist area #qanda
Don's story should be an Australian Story #qanda
How much faith can we have in Australia's military history when it is so regularly sanitised and corrupted? #QandA http://t.co/u8AdMgMV0T
Why are we still not properly addressing the huge mental health costs throughout society from continuing to send our young to wars. #qanda
If we didn't make such a big deal about #Anzac day how would the younger generations realise the importance of that war and that time #qanda
#qanda Fight for your country one day, homeless and forgotten the next...
Very hard for those who have been in war, to hear so much hot air and grandstanding about it from those who were never there #qanda
Wars are wrongly used as a political weapon,  the end.  #qanda
War is ugly. Full stop. #QandA
war is futile. when will we ever learn. and stop it. #qanda @qanda
@QandA money we give is money we have borrowed
Pa doesn't like to talk about it. Every war veteran is different but none of them would want the government to rewrite their stories. #qanda
culture wars museum just to be a few op eds on bikes in the cbd #qanda
War is censored so as not to offend those who don't leave the safety of their laptops #qanda
Arthur Sinodinis has resurfaced... #QandA
Julian Burnside  #QandA  A pity Australian Federal Police are not being held to account for dobbing Chan/Sukumaran in to Indonesian police
@pkaystpt because then Hitler would have won #qanda
@Hezza7 @annabelcrabb @QandA No, please, let's. Recrudescence now added to the lex
The cost of war is #freshinourmemories #qanda
ANZAC doesn't glorify war nor promotes it. It's our history. Can't be erased. Lest we forget! #qanda
We have many forgotten wars. Boer war, Korea, the Malayan emergency... #qanda
#QandA one of the forgotten war would be the first war indigenous australians fought against the colonist.
.@zackster fired for not stating on profile 'tweets are my own' - would that have saved him ? i dont fucking think so #qanda
All nationalism is toxic. It's like religious faith #qanda
Victors of war get to write the historical account #QandA
#QandA how do you sanitise the history of a drone? ctr + alt + delete
Anzac Day is unique in the world as being not about victory but defeat #qanda
The ministry of truth serves an important role, working in concert with the ministry of peace. #qanda
Gallipoli was an invasion of an already defeated country with the aim to carve it up among western powers #qanda
War...bloody waste of money. #QandA #AusPol @QandA
@QandA Government sanitize  War to suit them ...never lol #qanda
The historians should be the veterans, they were there #qanda
@RichardEdinger discussing qanda question re ANZAC day in aus. Some ppl claim that we're glorifying war, i disagree.
Sinodinos right. In free soc diff perspective on war, etc. That's why Left hates #freespeech. Can't dictate their line only. #QandA
Speaking about different versions of history, meanwhile Scott Mcintyre is publicly shamed for offering an alternate ANZAC narrative  @QandA
Censoring war will lead to the repetition of history @qanda @QandA
@QandA democracy means you won't go to jail for your opinion. It doesn't mean you'll keep your job!
And we aren't keeping refugees quiet, along the way, are we? #QandA
im watching purple rain #qanda
#qanda and the chemical murder of peoples of Vietnam by big companies like monsanto using agent orange and Naplam #terrorism
Wonder if Arfur will forget to take his pay for tonight's effort with him when he goes home. #QandA
#qanda glorification of the last war is important in getting people to show up for the next one
Politicians are the ones that send us to war, they should not be up there drumming up the glory of the sacrifice for King &amp; country #qanda
War has made Haliburton very profitable #qanda
#qanda Sick of armchair Historians. its time our history was written with the truth of the returned soldiers
#qanda Plibersek allows only a certain kind of conscience to speak! http://t.co/UuEd2MqYHC   Fickle-minded cry lady!
#qanda History, not just war, is edited
@qanda #qanda - Remember many aspects of war operations are very classified - and not downgraded of many years.
Evidently 'Deadline Gallipoli' was sewed with deeper issues still relevant in today's military history. #QandA
Watched 'Lest we Forget What?' reminded how returned Black Soldiers denied to drink with mates at certain clubs &lt;/3 #qanda
@AWMemorial any comments regarding sanitation of War records? #qanda
Kambah represent! @QandA #QandA
@SuLin_Tan Haha. Saw that. We were at one!! It's a #qanda night in!
@LachlanCuffe she must be on a govt grant/scholarship #qanda
#qanda Pity our national character wasn't born of great philosophical, artistic, creative achievement.
Anzac celebrations are just another excuse for some morons to over drink and make fools of themselves #qanda
Australia should celebrate becoming a nation without a shot being fired. Instead we link our birth to war #qanda
Dawn services glorify war in the way funerals glorify death #qanda
Why has no one thanked him for his service? What a total lack of respect #qanda
we need a journalist to release detials about the hiding of info.. oh damn, thats right they atrent allowed to #qanda
Australia tried to forget the whole Vietnam war #QandA
#qanda #ScottMcIntyre should of been put on some sort of suspension. No one should lose their job over opinions...such they are OPINIONS!
Side note: Me and @Doclach agree that @riotersbloc is amazing. If you aren't following her, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?! #qanda
I'm surprised Sinodinos can recall anything #qanda
The more I hear @tanya_plibersek speak the more I see her as the leader our country needs #qanda
The commercialisation of ANZAC day is a concern #qanda
@Peter_Fitz eagerly awaiting your response to "journalist historians" against "academic historians". #qanda
This sounds like that Yes Minister episode where everyone got angry and rioted #qanda
Excellent #qanda tonight
War coverage not sanitised? *cough* Collateral Murder *cough* #qanda
If we glorify war, why aren't we glorifying veterans? #qanda
The "coloured digger"? Will you get sacked for causing offence to Indigenous and People of Colour now? #QandA
#qanda focus on war &amp; drugs What about policy, economy, jobs, climate and other serious issues of the day? #auspoI
#QandA aboriginal diggers fighting for their racist nation state - truly ambassadorial.
#qanda do you doubt war record sanitisation? Remember embedded journalist?
Historians omitted the fact that engineers were even at Gallipoli, let alone being  the first to land #qanda
#TweetLikeScottMcIntyre now that's a dangerous hash tag #qanda
#QandA why does the war memorial refuse to acknowledge aboriginal wars in the face of white invasion?
I have gone to Anzac services for as long as I can remember. Will continue to do so and reflect in a sombre way. #qanda
Saying 'all your info prob got misplaced for a few decades' doesn't make situation better, just makes the War Memorial sound dodgy. #qanda
Sanitised - Victory over Japan is now Victory is  the Pacific #qanda
@seanjelinek @KermitMaree @QandA remember it was 1918 not 2015 when they returned!
How many kids would join up for military if the govt didnt glorify war and spin the history books? #QandA
The war veterans are a more reliable source that historians. #QandA
Surely if you have a public holiday that is about a military battle then on some level you're glorifying war. #qanda
@QandA #qanda  War Memorial should include a HUGE section on the aftermath of war at home - broken men, care wearied women.
ANZAC's fought "The war to end all wars". WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War 1, Yugoslavia, Gulf War 2, Afghanistan. Will we EVER learn? #qanda
First hand evidence and lived experiences of war are equally as important as bigger picture critical views provided by historians #qanda
@ajhamilton71 Well Yeah... There's obviously no close examination of your conduct, why wouldn't you? @QandA
I do hope that the Vietnam Vet questioner does not work for #SBS #qanda
We celebrate the "unknown soldier" but forget the 'known" ones! #qanda
Dad was a TPI veteran. #qanda
I remember a memorial in Picton New Zealand that commemorated "The Glorious Dead". To be honest I don't think there is such a thing. #QandA
It's always offensive to see two Australian flags &amp; only one Aboriginal flag on ANZAC Day #qanda
#QandA @QandA Sanitising history under #LNP? Never
"Props" to that questioner....lol #qanda
Someone needs to do a PhD on why #qanda hates Australia so much
Nepal is not high in our trade and economic interests... Let's be honest Arthur. #QandA
@QandA My uncle was shot at Kakoda.  He wasn't annoyed about that but how he was treated when he returned!
@Sir_scu8a: The Australian War Memorial still has statues of Aborigines amongst the 'Fauna' of Australia- #qanda
So glad #qanda included that video question, is our govt doing enough to support veterans in the long-term?
@QandA We should remember the earlier war, of indigenous people resisting invasion from 1788 on.
Is this the right time to discuss the inconvenient truth of veteran homelessness? #QandA
When will we start celebrating the Vietnam War #qanda
Your country needs you! (Up until you come back, because we can't afford to look after you). Disgusting. #QandA
Love seeing my tweets live on live tv thanks Auntie woo hoo yup qanda veteran
What a boring #qanda Tanya the only reason I am watching. She is excellent as usual.
We give kick backs to mining companies but kicked our vets to the kerb #qanda
The Greeks still commemorate the heroes at the battle of Thermopylae after 2500 years #qanda and the Greeks lost
What about men with German names who changed their name to fight for Australia #qanda
65% of the minimum wage is a lot better than pensioners on 28% of the minimum wage  #qanda
ANZAC days is the least sober day on the Australian calendar..ask anyone working in hospitality #qanda
Cost of war is much more than money #qanda
#QandA war can be detrimental to ones health
@QandA #QandA Why isn't ANZAC Day a proper public holiday any more? Saturday, so I had to work and could not assist a aged veteran relative.
War war, what is it good for #qanda
Gotta love the product placement in the background - walking stick and a digger's hat. Really? #QandA
The cost of war is too high to see the benefits #qanda
More should be done for those with Post Traumatic Stress syndrome #qanda
People with disabilities now more help in the country. The NDIS is the right step #qanda
It's not as simple as 'history is written by the victors' anymore. Rewriting victimhood has plenty of currency &amp; used to great effect #qanda
Truth.  #Chomsky #qanda http://t.co/5AzxzIbBVK
If we care about veterans with disability  then properly index their pensions #qanda
#qanda British Election - we have a democracy problem: Pat Condell, http://t.co/zhK979YeAp     Sounds familiar!
Tell when did they start talking about Australians at the western front isnt that editing history #qanda last few years
#ALP &amp; #LNP upset our expectations? Fine.. Lets upset theirs!!  FEDERAL ICAC NOW!! #FEDERALICACNOW  #auspol #qanda http://t.co/GlZWq5LiUw
#qanda at the very least #ScottMcIntyre has got us questioning the sanctimonious Anzac day commemorations.
We are not showing our injured military enough respect, they are thrown on the scrap heap, no longer helpful! #qanda
Yay @tanya_plibersek. Lest we forget those Aboriginal vets that were forgotten when they got home. #QandA
Tanya Plibersek is talking about this event commemorating our forgotten Indigenous servicemen. See I was there #qanda http://t.co/VLO9XAWRtC
It's good that #qanda is disassembling the myths of ANZAC Day and approaching the truth.
How dare we treat our veterans this way? The WWII veterans have mostly gone but were in the same boat. #qanda
The Japanese Emperor didn't cast his deciding vote to surrender until *AFTER* Nagasaki #Qanda
Soldiers are used by governments, dispensed with when no longer needed. #qanda
These people put themselves on the line, to be returned with trouble #QandA
So why is $100mil being spent on French memorials instead of vets who are here and still alive? #qanda
i wish tim fischer was my uncle #qanda
#QandA problem is the government would rather spend billions to keep children in detention
Our veterans and TPIs deserve better #qanda
Disabled diggers have been Dudded by both sides for years.  #qanda
#qanda Right out of USA handbooks Australian TPI for vets. Shock horror letting their guard down for those who served.
Slippage is a bastard term for vets losing benefits. #QandA
#qanda Says Tim who is living off the public purse pension he gets for life
#qanda The Labor Party are the only party who really look after the Vietnam Vets Mr Fischer
THe govt of the day has the responsibility to be accountable. Offshore prisons. #QandA
We need to look after TPI  veterans @QandA #QandA
@QandA Tony Jones is an arse! "Tanya Pliberseck wants to say something, we'll hear from her just briefly and then move on" #qanda #auspol
I wonder if Sinodinous will remember to follow up on that?  #qanda
Less monuments in France, more looking after our vets. #qanda
Some of the money spent on commemoration of the dead should go to rehabilitation of the living. #qanda
Hard to believe veterans are still falling through the cracks. #qanda
Don't let the truth get in the way of a good war story - and future Hollywood blockbuster #qanda
#QandA , thanks Tanya @tanya_plibersek, for acknowledging Aboriginal Soldiers
The Anzac legacy is one of tragedy, heartbreak and mateship. It's actually what separates us from nations who glorify war. #qanda
First time watching this show. Never EVER have I watched such white washed bullshit. This programme is disgusting! Tell the truth! #qanda
Yep, FACT: The First Australians went and fought in WWI then came back &amp; couldn't even get into the RSL except once a year, #AnzacDay #qanda
@ClaudiaLongsays This is the @QandA way! Its all just de rigueur. Someone's knee-capped the ABC &amp; tied the gag tightly. No other explanation
How's about se stop fighting in other country's wars? Spend the money on Education and Health. #QandA #AusPol @QandA
#qanda  the memorial to Australian Aboriginal diggers is a plaque in the bush, in sight of the war memorial.
#QandA @QandA War never determines who was right, only who is left
How are our veterans supposed to support their families? They put their lives on the line and come home to a step above poverty. #qanda
#QandA war - if it wasn't sanitised no one would go.

#QandA Tim Fisher hasn't change - he still waffles on a says fuck all.
"War, war. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing' said Elaine Benes #qanda
"Slippage" is such a cute way of saying "human rights abuse" #qanda
The strong good looking bronze statue of the Anzac seems far from the truth of the rotting corpse or the disabled veteran #qanda
#qanda @QandA but you do not look after them still more cuts to come
Shouldn't we also be responsible for the aftermath of wars that we start? (Eg. Iraq) #qanda
@ #qanda The first casualty of war is the truth!
Can we stop saying celebration and ANZAC Day in the same sentence. We commemorate, not celebrate. #qanda
So awful, not paying our veterans adequately is a "slippage"  #qanda
If we can't look after our soldiers when they come home, then we shouldn't be going to war #qanda
Its only now we are seeing the real cost of war. #QandA
#qanda If panelists were banned from sycophantically thanking the audience for their questions and wasting time, more could be discussed.
#qanda @QandA More Manley for TPI veterans, less many for convicted drug smugglers' legal battles'
We also have a responsibility not to generate 'TPI's through our actions abroad. #qanda
Is Tony back or is Warren still running the show? #qanda
I think we should ask @tanya_plibersek about same sex marriage. I mean who wouldn't want to see @Samara_McCann and I tie the knot? #qanda
Surely we can squeeze in a question to Tanya Plibersek about her push to legislate in favour of same-sex marriage? #qanda
Patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons #qanda
If @tanya_plibersek thinks Anzac Day reflections are "sober" it shows how little time she spends at the RSL.  #qanda #auspol
"both sides of politics" those with parliamentary pensions and everyone else #qanda
#qanda I guess one teams letting the side down, guess which one
Historian on #qanda erasing Aboriginal TSI people from history when saying that 1901 federation was the 'rip roaring years of the nation'
If there is one group who deserve no restrictions with payments, it's wounded and TPI veterans. #qanda
If the govt. is willing to pay for the weapons of war, they should be willing to pay for the maintenance of those weapons (soldiers). #qanda
The govt really doesn't like giving money out, do they? Sorry veterans and pensioners. #qanda
I was actually surprised how much of the horror of war was inc in Anzac commemoration pieces on the NRL Footy Show. Commendable. #qanda
#qanda ANZAC is a fantastic day to remember the fallen whom were sent to war.
The only lesson of history is that history repeats itself #qanda
Lest we forget... To pay them a reasonable wage #QandA
#qanda imagine if we there was no war anywhere in the world.
3 time more AUSTRALIAN soldiers suicide than die in combat http://t.co/eaZeBOn51D #qanda
#qanda and don't forget the Chinese ANZACS too who weren't white enough to begin with.
RedScareBot: Land of the Spree RT maxbulk This guy is probably a hard out marxist but he's hiding it pretty well #qanda
#QandA Seems like the meaning of #ANZAC has been reduced to be absorbed into popular culture... #ANZAC &lt;--anyone see anything ironic there?
ANZAC day is the least sober day on the Australian calendar..ask anyone working in hospitality #qanda
If the cost of war was the focus of ANZAC Day, how many bogans do you think knows how many Turkish/ Japanese soldiers died in WWI/2? #qanda
Glorifying the cost of war, and ripping off the veterans. #ShameOnYou #QandA
@annabelcrabb @QandA I need to consult my Oxford dictionary re recrudescence
Use more of my tax money for these injured veterans. #qanda
There are too many broken soldiers who return from war without the support they need #qanda
#QandA what country can afford to forget it's injured veterans? Regardless of physical or mental scars
#QandA powerful people make lots of money out of war..not the soldiers though, mostly arms manufacturers
The hype over Anzac Day, and the failure of Australia Day, shows Australia still struggles with a national day. Melb cup day wins #qanda
#qanda Union loan of $500,000 to NSW Labor Party faces investigation by #turc! http://t.co/v1MQxpnQkI
ANZAC day should focus on reminding us how pointless all the death and destruction was without focusing on glorifying war #qanda
Elaborate ANZAC celebrations and reduction of veterans support. Government sentiment sounding false. #qanda
If we are going to short change our Veterans then we really need to have a good look at ourselves #QandA
That $100million for the library in France would go a long way to supporting disabled veterans. #qanda
We're happy to honour the Anzacs. But those returning home damaged from service now? Not so much hey #auspol? #qanda
Our government has the role to look after our veterans. They also have the role to stop making new ones without outcomes #qanda #auspol
Maybe spending less on commemoration? #QandA
The way we treat veterans suffering with TPI and PTSD is shameful #qanda
The competence of command is overstated and the cowardice hidden from the sanitised public record. Every servicemen knows of both. #qanda
War happens because of inflated men's egos that compensate for an inferior self. Greed power control conflict pride - symptoms of ego #qanda
@forthleft #qanda People now have to sign away their rights including the right to free speech just to get a job.
The families of veterans carry the burden of war - past and present #qanda
Money doesn't magically fix PTSD and lifelong trauma #QandA
Remember those that were lost, and those that are still alive #QandA
This govt is not looking after our veterans. TPI vets need better support. #qanda
#qanda first casualty of a war is information-everything is sanitised under the cloak of security. So atrocities happen.
#QandA  It is easier to remember 100 years ago than deal with the present
That Vet's PTSD must be through the roof! Imagine being called a LIAR when you fought &amp; were wounded &amp; no record of your bravery?? #qanda
#Qanda someone please ask Arthur about ICAC.
$100 million on a new war memorial might be better spent on veterans welfare #qanda
Like I said... if you can't support your returned soldiers, don't fucking send more to be under supported when they return #QandA
@QandA #QandA https://t.co/vGmsgEm7Om
#qanda Thanks @tanya_plibersek for speaking about the coloured diggers. Important to make that part of our narrative.
Do those who attack our fallen comrades in world wars donate to Legacy? No, didn't think so. #qanda
#QandA Yes and neither side of politics have ever provided the support. Fair pay.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could praise our veterans for fighting in bastard wars?  #qanda
If people can by new plasmas every year, our returned service men and women should be able to do this every MONTH! #qanda
@QandA @TurnbullMalcolm Perhaps not. Those against the tweets would be called rednecks or worse. I'm fed up with "free speech" defence.

We wouldn't be the country we are with out the war veterans today #QandA
@triplejHack after tonight's @QandA you might need to re-do your Anzac week special. Mind blown!
The Jingo approach to ANZAC day for political expediency is more in line with Nazism &amp; Fascism than democracy #QandA
#qanda The Liberal government only cares about welfare recipients if they can capitalise on their demonisation.
Australia: nation that reduces foreign aid/benefits, increases taxes for the poor and promotes and glorifies war. Hmmm! @qanda

#QandA Its all political rhetoric! They will use anything &amp; everthing for their objectives &amp; gratification ! Pork barrelling, Spin Doctoring
@qanda #qanda Too much is NEVER enough to compensate our veterans.
@forthleft @DameyonBonson Yes, this is also the reason why academia has faded into a pale reverberation of establishment thinking #qanda
The excessive money spent on commemorations could've been better spent on veterans' services. #qanda
@Henjam48 @QandA ... Please look at ur twitter account u cannot b serious can u

#QandA well said @tanya_plibersek re Anzac day not being a day of glorifying war. It is simply day of remembrance and sadness.
Have Anzac Day every 5 years for recognising and having compassion for the lives lost and those it affected, not why they went to war #qanda
These soldiers deserve more- Enough evidence that there are opportunities for improving commemoration &amp; support of soldiers #qanda
Liberal's are full of rhetoric tonight on #qanda
The only reason they started ANZAC day was they were worried all those dead left would be forgotten...well we have remembered them #qanda

@newscomauHQ @tomporteous @QandA We could begin by reflecting on the truth of war rather than a parade of celebrities.
#qanda we abhor capital punishment and all forms of human killing. Except one, which we Honour and glorify. Is nationhood that important?
At least the Govt are being fair - they expect war vets, aged pensioners, unemployed and students all to live in poverty. #QandA

65% of minimum wage is not complex. It's a ripoff #qanda  https://t.co/lvYA3ZzKnJ

#QandA why do we treat prisoners better than pensioners and veterans?

#qanda just saw my Dad ask a question from the audience! Go Dad! Been fighting this for so long... Just wrong
So the government pays politicians until the die, but we don't look after our Diggers? #qanda
Surely something less than $100m out of the budget for a new memorial in France to redirect funds to TPI's #qanda
#qanda Lift your game Arthur, you were a lot better on ICAC...I guess it was your arse on the line there...
Current budgetary environment $4 million for climate deniers? 250 million for a building in France ????? #qanda

Veterans won't even be able to fill their petrol tank let alone drive over an east west link that doesn't exist #qanda
Why are wasting so much money?? @QandA  #qanda
$430 million was Abbott's big wet dream all along #qanda
Because it's the centenary. The amount spent is justified #qanda
All current soldiers go by choice. Why should there be any special benefits for them over others. #qanda
But if you have a public discussion and public disagrees you risk getting fired #qanda
While politicians wax lyrical about the achievements of servicemen a century ago, the soldiers of today are neglected and forgotten. #qanda
$430 m on glorifying war #qanda @qanda #nationaldisgrace
@qanda Government will shortchange veterans, but won't stand up to tax dodging corporations
If we can afford to spend money to send, equip and support them. Then the government can fully support our returned service personnel #QandA

Spend money commemorating Anzac or spend money helping veterans with payments?? #ujcomm2657 #qanda
@PrimaBaci @QandA  yes
Governments spend absurd amounts to send a person to war once they get back they don't want to know them  #qanda
spend $100 million to build a war centre in France, strip the payments from veterans. makes complete sense. #QandA
#qanda Who said a bayonet was a weapon with a worker on both ends? Then we pension them. $430million????????
#qanda $430 million? FFS!!! Give it to Vets.
Our #QandA panel responds to compensation for permanently disabled veterans being 65% of minimum wage http://t.co/tECDPcHvev
War veterans, foreign aid, asylum seekers - Australia doesn't care. #QandA
Well, I can't imagine Germany spending a packet on commemorating WWI #qanda
80 - 90% of casualties of the wars of the 20th century were civilians #qanda
#QandA these veterans should be looked after and not only glorified on Anzac day
They survived the front line, but not the government's bottom line #qanda
Hey guys, don't worry. Hockey's looking after our budget. You're all getting nothing. #qanda
Seriously, where are my taxes going? Is anyone getting support (veterans, refugees, pensioners, Nepal, schools, hospitals...) #qanda
Great point on the #ANZAC spending. #QandA
@newscomauHQ @QandA Is Tanya PlumbersCrack their saviour or is Joker just extending his deadly game play ?
This is the kind of answer we want. Thanks Carolyn. #qanda
@qanda if injured in workplace workplace relation legislation ensures financial support. Why not Defense
Those TPI diggers have to sacrifice so we can afford to celebrate Anzac Day  #qanda
$100 million for a building in France and yet injured returned soldiers no money for them #QandA
Germany 7 million. Not a lot  to commemorate there though... #qanda
What a way to repay our brave soldiers. Hand them more struggle, as if they haven't sacrificed enough for us already! #qanda @QandA
There's votes in monuments not in veterans #qanda

Australia spends so much money on "commemorating" the war, because Abbott actually does want a "patriotic" militarised Australia. #qanda
#qanda  abbott #warmonger #JingoismJunkie

Can we stop using 'celebrate' and 'ANZAC day' in the same sentence. We commemorate, we don't celebrate. #qanda
Veterans deserve better! @qanda @QandA
$430m is an obscene amount to have spent on #ANZAC commemorations.  Surely could have done a great job for 1/10 of that? #qanda
Canada...you cheap bastards #qanda @QandA
#QandA I lost a best friend in a car accident and suffer PTSD. Why don't I get money and support from the government?

@QandA @tanya_plibersek For crying out loud.  What do you want us to do? Modest is better than than nothing and better than overbearing.

#qanda $430million on #Anzac celebrations but there is a budget emergency?

$435m spent on commemorating ANZAC .....that seems like a helluva lot #qanda
The Abbott govt wastes $430m commemorating WW1.  Vets deserve a better deal on the indexing of pensions. #qanda
Our priorities are all wrong, ceremonies are more important than people  #qanda
$430m puts the focus on ANZAC and away from the incompetence of Abbott #qanda
Given the lack of support for returned veterans, makes you wonder why people voluntarily sign up for the military in the modern age #QandA
#qanda gives new meaning to cutting our veterans off at the knees.

Yesss @tanya_plibersek #qanda
@tanya_plibersek #qanda labor won't lose my vote for supporting marriage equality #Labor
yeah there's nothing democratic about giving people equal rights under the law good point #qanda
Marriage equality isn't a matter of life and death. It is not a conscience issue. #qanda
It will gain more votes for the Labor party #QandA
@SigmundMarx gets audience applause re fed govt $$ on Anzac commemorations #QandA
People r dying of poverty, war, child abuse. Babies r born drug addicted. Who deserves help most: innocent victims or drug smugglers? #QandA
Tell it Tanya! #qanda
Marriage equality is just obvious.  Support it. #qanda
Given the choice between recognising basic human rights and bigotry, I choose recognition #qanda
#qanda We should link veterans perks to politicians perks and see how they go then
@QandA #QandA Marriage Equality is the right thing to do. Everyone should have equal rights to be miserable :)
#QandA exploring different formats of taking questions tonight is a nice change #ujcomm2657
#qanda Tania takes the ALP into the twenty first century @qanda
#Qanda because my right to marry is NOT an issue of your conscience!
@Joe_Hildebrand @adamzwar Which nations glorify war? Tragedy, heartbreak &amp; mateship are present in all wars &amp; felt by every nation. #qanda
Foreign aid or more support for our veterans, make a choice as we can't afford both!!! #qanda
The vast majority of Australians support equal marriage. It wins votes. #qanda
Well said Tanya #qanda
More focus on a war of GREED &amp; OIL (WW1) with this $100M memorial. Are we GLORIFYING WAR? #qanda
Cost of war should include executive level wages for life for all returned vets. Can't afford it? Then don't go to war.  #QandA
We honour veterans with a public holiday, but not with good welfare? Shame #qanda
We should have same sex marriage by now nationwide!!! #qanda
let's change ANZAC day to Veterans Day to commemorate all those who served in all wars #qanda
At this point, put it to the people! We are a democracy after all, right?! #QandA
The pressure should be on the Coalition to allow their MPs a conscience vote. #QandA
Australia is spending more on war glorification than the rest of the world combined. And then some. $442 million. #budgetcrisis #qanda
@qanda #qanda it's not an issue of conscience. it's an issue of equality before the law.
@QandA 400million for propaganda...war is stone age activity...let's move past it. #qanda
Fucking bullshit Tim Fischer we already have a centre at Villers-Bretonneux, you moron!! #qanda
It really shouldn't be a debate anymore #QandA We need change.
Equal marriage should be a basic right #qanda
Well done to #qanda tonight for tackling ideas around what it is to be a modern Australian, not just petty partisan financial squabbling
The western front the forgotten front of Australia the familys remeber #qanda disgrace
Equality is not a conscience issue. Equality is a human right! #QandA
Let both sides of politics allow a conscience vote on marriage equality. #qanda
"Slippage", "unfinished business" &amp; "a very complex area" ~ Fisher on #Veterans' pensions - govt spends $430m on #WWI commemorations! #qanda
They are free to marry, just not someone of the same gender. #qanda
Will gay marriage be compulsory .....yes it will.. #qanda
#qanda maybe because it's the 21st century and we should have policies and laws that reflect it #marriagequality
I fully support marriage equality. @tanya_plibersek for PM! #qanda
Literal there is 0 argument against granting people human rights #QandA
Just. Plibz. Forever  #qanda
So Disabled soldiers are treated the same as regular disabled peeps then? #QandA
Forgo school chaplain scheme &amp; support veterans. #TPI #RSL #qanda #auspol
#QandA ICAC question long overdue. Otherwise why have Arthur on the show?
I have a big gay crush on Tanya Plibersek #qanda
$430,000,000 spent by govt on #Anzac100? Seems pretty expensive drumming up support for new wars. #qanda @QandA #auspol
How can same-sex marriage be undemocratic...? Surely the assholes are the minority #qanda
Marriage equality SHOULDN'T be an issue! End of discussion! #QandA
Why should parliamentarians be forced to vote for motherless or fatherless families? #qanda
As a parent of a gay daughter, whoever legalises same sex marriage will get my vote. #qanda
What about eye equality? #qanda
ch 9 is airing a show on insttant marrages but yet gays can't? #Qanda @QandA
Finally we get to #marriagequality with a minute or two to go! @QandA #qanda
In 5 years, we will have marriage equality. @QandA #QandA
@tanya_plibersek had championed human &amp; legal rights in the Labor party - will only strengthen number of votes #qanda
Tim Fisher's title on #qanda tonight is Vietnam Veteran because that suits tonights narrative #qanda
I wish I were a woman so I could gay marry Tanya!.... Oh wait #QandA
Tanya please marry me #qanda @QandA
Don't like same sex marriage, easy, don't marry someone of the same sex. #qanda
#qanda
Are you for discrimination? No? Then it's time to stand up for marriage equal you @NSWLabor @AustralianLabor @AlexHamiltonAUS #qanda
#qanda Australia needs to get with the programme #marriagequality
@correzpond: Australian Government spending $430m on WW1 ceremonies is manipulation not commemoration #qanda
$430m to celebrate WW1? Seems money well spent to me #qanda http://t.co/ctvJOLiZxu
Yes I'm sure Paul from the Hills District *cough Bible Belt cough* was a staunch Labor voter until today. #qanda
It's about Equity! Equity for everyone! #qanda
Why should equality be subject to the personal whim of religious bigots? #QandA
Marriage equality. Long overdue for change in Australia. No brainer. #QandA
Because if people are going to condemn people for being bigots they cannot give themselves the same right.  #qanda
Our country is slipping behind the world on same sex marriage. Why are we so afraid of this question? #qanda
For those against gay marriage, and want it no longer talked about, allow it, then it won't be talked about again! #qanda
We don't want to be on the wrong side of history. #qanda
Removing conscious vote is a defensive tactic in response to rightly bleeding votes to the greens. #qanda
Marriage equality? What about equality for the child? #qanda
In the 21st Century how is same sex marriage even a question? Ridiculous #backwardthinking #qanda
#marriagequality is an issue that's long overdue. YES POLITICIANS SHOULD REPRESENT THE PEOPLE. Not their personal views #qanda
Labor are in danger of stuffing this debate by moving away from a conscience vote #QandA
The ALP needs to stop listening to Joe de Bruyn #QandA
#qanda Since when did the government have a right to a say in marriage?
Government should just butt out of marriage completely. It should be a private matter for citizens. #qanda
The $100million would be better spent on those that need it like the veterans and Nepal rather than a library in France #qanda
@qanda marriage equality is about equal rights for all - would you allow a concscience vote on if black people should have rights? no
Marriage equality must happen. It's long overdue. Australia is stuck in the past. #qanda
Marriage should be between two people who genuinely love each other, regardless of gender. #qanda
As the member for Sydney, where was .@tanya_plibersek during Mardi Gras? #QandA
if $430mil was that for the 100year commemoration and lower on standard years #qanda
Yes! Western front has long been ignored! @QandA #qanda
@QandA #QandA DO NOT Destroy the family!!!
i think everyone should vote to get a conscience #qanda
Who cares who marries who in the 21st century? Surely it's time to change the rules and move on #QandA
Same sex marriage will create another industry and the government will make a ton out of it @QandA
New Zealand (you know, the NZ part of ANZAC?) is way ahead of Australia in terms of marriage equality. #justsaying #qanda
Because, Tanya is being the voice for the majority of Aus- please get on with it!! #qanda
All Australians should have the right to be as unhappily married as everyone else! #QandA
I just can't take anything Plibersek does as sincere. #qanda
Tanya's got Bill by the short-and-curlies #Qanda
#qanda we just spent $430m on ww1 remembered.
#qanda Blah, blah, blah.Tanya trying to shore up her inner-city luvvie demographic for that inevitable challenge to Bill Shorten.
@bradthegunn Howard privatised Repatriation Hospitals for War Veterans like Hollywood Hospital here in Perth #qanda
#qanda ... Oh please .... So many distorted tweets tonight
Or it might gain them votes, Paul. #qanda
"Is marriage equality something that should happen in Australia? Yes it is." @tanya_plibersek #qanda
Seriously, if you want to hear something profound about war, here's Keating's Eulogy for the Unknown Soldier #qanda https://t.co/LmW90MVbvQ
If the ALP wants to distance itself from the LNP it should stop breaching human rights. This is a good first step. #qanda
2015. Get with it Australia. #qanda
It's discrimination. That's it. #qanda
any Labor member who's conscience vote is against marriage equality should seriously consider whether their membership is valid #qanda
Will Libs allow conscience vote? #qanda
Oh yes and Tanya Plibersek is such a authoritarian fascist #qanda
Oh good the point in the show when my life is debated. #sarcasm #qanda
#QandA   Good for you Tania you speak from a principled foundation
Discrimination happens regardless of whether it's supported or not #qanda
Australia... The only developed country in the world that doesn't have #marriagequality #QandA
How funds allocated by govt's a shambles - primary aim seems to be how to stay in power. Is this where "democracy" is heading? #QandA
Wait the labor party still exists? where the hell have they been all year? #qanda #auspol
Why not solve the problem by not calling it marriage? Legal partnerships? #QandA
@qanda $450 billion spent on ANZAC DAY, but cuts funding to Indigenous, Women's, health, welfare services/orgs.
Our politicians should vote with how the electorate feels. And it overwhelmingly says yes to marriage equality #qanda #auspol
Shouldn't members of parliament represent their electorate's view rather than their own ? #qanda
#qanda @QandA thank you @tanya_plibersek for standing with gay community
@QandA #QandA A binding vote will "lose Labor votes" according to a questioner. From who? homophobic bigots? Good riddance to homophobes!
Embarrassing that we're still not there. It's JUST people getting married. Let everyone bloody do it! #QandA
Bugger damaged veterans, let's build huge monuments all over the place. #qanda
#qanda Why is Australia now behind France Spain England and even Brazil when it comes to marriage equality?
Tanya Plibersek is talking sense on #QandA. Burn the witch.
Same sex marriages will increase the divorce rate #qanda
As an ALP member, I don't support MPs being forced to vote in a certain way esp when it goes against what their community wants #qanda
How about Australia stop acting backwards and just get on with it #qanda
Labor are only supposed to have mandatory votes on losses of freedom like #Metadata. Not gains in freedom #qanda
no need to write those tweets on a day of rememberence #qanda
I am so sick of talking about marriage equality #qanda
Tanya, it's been made clear this will cause a huge division within Labor, but not for you in your safe seat #qanda
#qanda Marriage existed long before religion.
$430million spent by gov on commemorations of Anzac!  Give it to the veterans still living, not on flowers for the dead!   #QandA
Same-sex marriage. We're still debating it? FFS, just get it over and done with. #qanda
Conscience votes are for moral questions aren't they? #qanda
Go Tanya. Completely and utterly agree with you!!! 100% #qanda
@TonyAbbottMHR spending 300mil because photo ops not as good with disabled vets in poverty #qanda
It's embarrassing that the UK legislated it before us. And the US is about to. #qanda
#marriageequality is an issue of fundamental human rights, &amp; not of individual conscience. #ItsTimeToBind #qanda
2/3rds of australians WANT mariage equality #qanda
#qanda $430 million could've better spent on living people
@whatjanesays @FootyClassified take themselves almost as seriously as @QandA when they talk about capital punishment. It's just footy guys!
And that is why @tanya_plibersek should be our leader #qanda
Good on ya @tanya_plibersek End the discrimination on same sex marriage! #QandA #AusPol @QandA
#qanda another statue another memorial and not enough $$$ for the veterans there is no excuse for this
Yes! Let's talk about #gaymarriage! #qanda #ujcomm2657
It is a clear and strong stand, Labor supports equality.  #qanda
@StephenJonesMP had it right years ago. @AustralianLabor need to catch up  #qanda
Beautifully put @tanya_plibersek: change is long overdue. #qanda
In Oz you can love as you please but you don't need to call a homosexual union a marriage  #qanda
@QandA here's a hornets' nest!!
We don't want to all get married, but the choice would be great. Lawyers would love it. #QandA
We can be a part of the history of equality, or we can be tarnished by it #qanda
Why don't we commemorate our indigenous Australians who fell thanks to genocide. Selective history. #qanda
#qanda @qanda come on Tony. Tell us you will report back on the vets concerns  once Arthur Sinondinos has finished his investigation.

#qanda politicians pension should not be more than veterans' and those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Fair?
If you don't like gay marriage, don't have one. But don't go about stopping everything you don't like #qanda
#qanda I would prefer my tax dollars go to Veterans who need the money now. Not spent on a $100M centre in France.
Agree. Marry who you want. #QandA
This is such a great discussion. #QANDA
Denying a certain portion of the the population of a chance to get married sounds profoundly undemocratic to me. #qanda
@AuntyNeville664 ..little politically correct piss ants who can't handle reality...sooks #qanda
The Labor Party needs to make up for its appalling failure on SSM while it was in government. Thanks for nothing Julia by the way. #qanda
#qanda another example where religion interferes with politics
Because discrimination is unconscionable, of course. #QandA
The Labor party should stand for something. I'm very happy if that something is marriage equality. (And admittedly not much else) #qanda
#qanda is Tanya have a shot at the title while Bill is away - but is gay marriage a killer punch?
Let those who don't support marriage equality be visible. Let the voters decide.  #qanda
@QandA Tanya Plibersek always speaks from the heart.
Let's see the libs complain about the lack of a conscious vote #qanda
Good on you @tanya_plibersek  #qanda
@sandmoc2 @QandA Wrong and unfair
Only problem with conscience votes and politicians is that politicians don't have consciences @qanda #qanda
Voting against your conscience is absurd and undemocratic #qanda
Nepal foreign aid freedom of speech the death penalty and same sex marriage ... only on #qanda
#qanda Vic Premier Dan Andrews is a Joan Kirner in a Collin St suit! http://t.co/VjmFwrVdGg
Equality under law should not be optional. #qanda
Will TV marriage be legal...no it wont #qanda
On a marriage equality scale between 1 and Russia... #qanda
I think Tanya's move is a move forward on #MarriageEquality the party should take the line! #qanda
Oi Abbott!  How about the $100 million to veteran's health and welfare instead of a building in France?  Oh, and a decent pay deal.  #QandA
People who move away from Labor for supporting same-sex marriage aren't serious Labor folk anyway. #qanda
Separation of church and state is essential in a free country. @qanda @QandA
#QandA Q put tp Plibersek. Will Tony let her answer wothout interrupting?
The system was set up to vote for the constituents! Party or conscience, both are wrong! #QandA @QandA
Yes. Please let all my gay and lesbian friends marry. Especially @MarianRakosi and @RiaCSantos #qanda
random retweets from #aussie #QandA https://t.co/u6uW1VkQQe
#qanda politicians are not theologians.  They should not define marriage.  They should define rights and have civil unions.
#QandA The ALP has been the party to end discrimination in Australia, the time is now to continue to fight for #marriagequality
All marriages about having the same sex! #QandA
OH . . . . . FFS let them get married so my niece can make their cakes @regniercakes  #QandA
Take the power away from churches @QandA #QandA

Over 21,000 millionaires were created during World War 1 in the United States - Take the Profit out of War to end all wars. #QandA
Let's be honest, Australia is pretty far behind when it comes to a lot of things. This includes marriage equality. #qanda
@dannolan i still can't bring myself to do a single qanda tweet without swearing
#QandA the issue is why do people care so much on who someone wants to marry?
#qanda Perhaps we glorify war to compensate for the sense of the waste of it.
Well said @tanya_plibersek . Not supporting marriage equality is supporting discrimination against members of our community. #qanda
What rubbish #qanda bed calls
Parliamentarians are elected to represent their population. The Australian public wants marriage equality #qanda
When did equality before the law become a "conscience vote" issue? #QandA
How govt treats returning soldiers &amp; their physical/mental needs is a measure of society as a whole.. we're not measuring up. #qanda
What a loaded question #qanda
@QandA #qanda If we do want to spend more on #foreignaid and #Veterans we need to ask where should the funds come from?
Why are we still having this debate? All love is equal #qanda
#qanda its non of the governments business what I do in my bedroom . It's 2015!

Isn't it the norm to vote on party lines? #qanda
If Tanya Plibersek was ALP leader, I'd vote ALP with pride rather than for Shorten just to get rid of Abbott #qanda
Maybe we could build a $100M memorial to the Western Front in Western Sydney instead. Think of the votes! #QandA
@QandA caucus.. derrr #quanda #auspol

#qanda  https://t.co/P2WkncwvXi
Whether you support/oppose gay marriage, Plibersek has demonstrated the use of Labor's clenched fist to smash opposing views. #qanda #auspol
So it's okay for Tony Abbott to force LNP people to vote against marriage equality, but Plibersek can't do the opposite? #qanda
I want Tanya for PM   #qanda
Tonight has shown why @SenatorWong is a much better future Labor leader than @tanya_plibersek. #qanda
Why is Australia so behind the times when it comes to marriage equality?  #qanda
A lot of the negative text, tweets and comments are from as far as I'm concerned are by a uneducated people. #qanda
@QandA should be not as a party, but as a country. #qanda
The majority of people want gay marriage, political parties act scared, when they don't need to! #qanda
Of those who believe ANZACS fought for our freedoms, how many believe that extends to same sex couples? #qanda @QandA
#qanda love Tanya's moral stance and conviction. Rare that a politician says what they really believe
Good on you Tanja! #QandA
The politics of remembrance. Photo ops? In the national interest Veterans support? Debt &amp; deficit reduction opportunity #qanda

I'm so bored with the inertia on this issue #qanda
Marriage equality is a human rights issue. Simple. Let's fix it now. History is an unstoppable tide. #qanda

#QandA Politicians represent the wants of the people not their conscience. Gay marriage is long overdue

YES YES. It's about discrimination. Not your personal 'icky' categories #qanda #marriagequality
There are too many  religious views, marriage isn't owned by the church #QandA
Because the labor party is about fairness and marriage equality is fair.  #qanda
Oh FFS Why bother with Sinodinus. Same as Andrew Robb Last week. I could whack the elephant with a Sledgehammer and you'd ignore me. #qanda
#qanda equality should not be based conscience votes. its a fundamental human right
@AusPublica #qanda If we dont act on climate change, our children will hold dawn services for civilisation &amp; Anzacs will seem irrelevant
being against Marriage equality is like being angry at strangers in food court for eating sushi. @tanya_plibersek point out absurdity #qanda

Anzac Day for boozers? Surely not. I only saw every pub I drove past overflowing with pissheads. #qanda
Another example of freedom of speech being stunted by a person's workplace/organisation #qanda
@QandA I have no idea why anyone should care about why our neighbours may love a person of the same sex
Are we in danger of simplifying the sanctity of marriage to an act of legality? #qanda
I love hearing about whether or not politicians can find it within their conscious to grant my partner and I the right to marry. #qanda
How about helping the civilians in the countries in which we go to war too. The so called 'collateral damage'. #qanda
Not supporting #MarriageEquality is allowing discrimination in our society #qanda
In labor they vote in blocks. It's what they do its how they work on a multitude of contentious issues  #qanda
Why is there a show like MarriedatFirstSight, but oppose equal marriage?The message?Marry anyone you like, as long as you're straight #qanda
The question should be are you for or against gay marriage. The question should be are you for or against discrimination. #qanda
Slow and cautious approach for same sex equality gets you no where! @QandA #QandA
Why is there a need to be slow on this issue it's 2015. #qanda
Dear bigots, Tanya P is merely advocating the right to gay marriage, not to make it compulsory.  #qanda

#qanda doesn't make sense to care about victims of natural disaster yet no concern for genuine &amp;desperate refugees fleeing human conflicts
#QandA why are we still debating marriage equality?!
#qanda try to remember that LGBT rights is more than marriage equality.
Marriage equality is still an inequality in this country. Get it together, catch up Australia. #qanda
Should be called a "no conscience" vote. #qanda
Typical Lib. Labor says up an he automatically says down. Opposition from government. #QandA
What happens between people in a peaceful, loving, consensual relationship is none of our business. #qanda
So we support discrimination against children? #qanda
I was planning to go to bed early tonight, however quite intrigued by tonight's discussions #qanda
Can't believe this is still something we're debating bring on #marriageequality #qanda
LGBTQI marriage is only fair. Labor is doing right, fearing nought. #QandA
@QandA nobody glorifies war. We have the day 2 remind us what happened.
There are veterans suffering but we're spending millions of dollars on constructing a jingoist nationalism #twistedpriorities #qanda
Come the fuck on people. We are in 2015. People who love each other deserve the basic human rights. #qanda
In my humble opinion, 'marriage equality' usually means "what's yours is yours, what's mine is yours too, dear". Sigh. #qanda
This should not be a 'conscience' vote as it is about basic human rights. Just do it. #QandA
Why is the Senator upset? His logic doesn't make any sense. #qanda

About time we ended discrimination on lbgtiq people!!! #qanda
#QandA  There has been a very slow and cautious approach for decades time to act now
#qanda #auspol Tanya is philosophically correct. But gay marriage is the biggest waste of the gay lobby effort since law reform/antiDiscrim
It the Labor party collectively have a majority vote for same-sex marriage, can it not be party policy? #QandA

Why didn't Plibersek challenge Gillard and Rudd on marriage equality? #qanda

c'mon tanya a little more enthusiasm if this is something that you care about! #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Using that argument I hope the ALP will strongly support a non-discrimination clause for a recognise referendum #qanda
@tanya_plibersek for PM #qanda

"We don't support discrimination" #marriagequality @tanya_plibersek #qanda
@qanda #qanda well there we have it. Liberal party actions are defined by what Labor does.
Allow churches to choose if they want to marry same-sex couples or not. Simple #QandA
Oh FFS #theirabc #qanda #mediawatch
@qanda the conservatives would still be against equal rights for women if conscience votes were allowed
#qanda same sex marriage now a get put card by use of the word discrimination, this word is so over used
Will gay marriage be legal in Iran? #qanda
Tanya for PM #qanda
Labor can't have a conscience vote because they have too many homophobes in parliament. #QandA
The fact so much is spent on commemorating a war that occurred 100 years ago highlights the whole point of Anzac Day has been missed. #qanda
#qanda Jones couldn't bring himself to mention "openly gay" senator's party
This is a big error of judgment on Plibersek's part. Creates a civil war in ALP &amp; gives Abbott breathing space he doesn't deserve #qanda
@QandA marriage equality should be about LOVE not politics.
Well I suppose if you won't allow a conscience vote on refugees, why would you want one on gay marriage? #QandA

Plibersek thank you for reminding your own party what your policy states. Yes bind them to it! #EqualLove #QandA
Why is this still an issue. It harms no one and would make a lot of people very happy. Legalise gay marriage #qanda
Politicians &amp; conscience - oxymoron? #qanda
Marriage equality is not about taking anything away from anyone. Traditionalists can still have their traditions. #qanda
The LGBTIQ community is pretty bloody sick of "slow and cautious". #qanda
Tanya has pushed the boat out on marriage equality. #QandA #ujcomm2657
Looks like Plibersek is trying to show that she is leadership material as much as anything else ... #QandA #marriageequality
Marriage is a CONTRACT!!! It has nothing to do with your sexual preference. #qanda
Dean Smith only recently changed his view on marriage equality. Don't see how his opinion is really valid #QandA
Plibersek's move is probably the result of Greens surging in Balmain and Newtown which overlap her electorate. #qanda
"Slow and Cautious". ie Never. #Qanda
All parties have collective conscience on certain issues, this is no different #QandA
Another issue that shouldn't be up to political bickering, marriage equality has to be allowed #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Decided lack of political point scoring on tonight's #QandA makes for much more enjoyable watching
2015 and still live in a country where people are not treated equally over something as simplistic as marriage. #QandA
Labour had 6 years to bring in marriage equality- easy to be politically correct when in opposition #qanda
Perhaps climate action, tax reform, education should come under conscience votes. Why have party lines?  #qanda
I'm sorry, but have you seen @SenatorWong's beautiful family? We NEED marriage equality. #QandA
Labor removing conscience vote is a defensive tactic to protect against votes lost to greens. #qanda

#qanda This is a must-read. Building up a dirty Labor govt deal! http://t.co/HwNaZimFbA    Disgraceful &amp; no respect for the state at all!
That argument is silly Every choice you make is discrimination to the person who isn't picked  #qanda
Gay marriage is so stupidly overdue I've already moved onto gay divorce. #qanda
Every vote should be a conscience vote and Labor's policy of kicking out dissenters is abhorrent #qanda

Give the public the chance to vote on this!  #qanda
#qanda I completely agree with Tanya on marriage equality, and religious excuses DO NOT belong in parliament, so don't  even!
Oh great, because the Libs have one gay senator we can base it on him. #QandA
The sooner that ALP distance themselves from De Bruyn and his dinosaur ways, the better. #Qanda
If you want to marry someone you love who has the right to stop you? No one. #qanda
Marriage equality is NOT a matter of life of death! #qanda
#qanda pure hypocrisy a Liberal lecturing Labor on marriage equality. What a joke.
Most Australians support gay marriage. This is a non-issue. Get on with it and legalise gay marriage. #QandA
Marriage equality - the reasons are clear #growingupqueer we don't support discrimination - it's bad for #mentalhealth #qanda
Refreshingly, @tanya_plibersek is trying to give Labor the progressive kick it needs. Congrats on showing bold leadership, Tanya #qanda
Lets do what the French do - give out general marriage certificates to all @QandA #QandA
Dear Aussie politicians, you're out of step with Aussie's opinion of Marrige-Equality #QandA #AusPol @QandA
You don't need a conscience vote to fix a violation of human rights #qanda
Who cares if men marry men and viceversa. Be cool with it #QandA @QandA
@newscomauHQ @tanya_plibersek @QandA  Says the Village Idiot! #auspol
#qanda It's outrageous that Australia discriminates against people by saying some citizens can marry and some can't.
Why aren't all votes free? #qanda
#qanda Making marriage equality ALP policy will only harden attitudes on the other side
Surely in 2015 marriage equality should be a non issue. Let's just do it  #qanda
Have a referendum - then you'll get the answer #qanda
A major party taking a binding position in favour of marriage equality is something that will set the cause back? Seriously? #qanda
Liberals do not care about equality, that not what they're there for. Labor needs a binding vote for it to happen! #qanda
#qanda government need to spend $100 million on war vets, general health system in Australia Victoria alone.
But not discriminating against minorities would be so gosh darn unaustralian! #qanda
We'll introduce same-sex marriage, then look back and wonder what the fuss was about. #qanda
Mr Garrison speaks conservative "truth" on marriage equality. #QandA
There's no need for a $100m centre at Western Front. The memorial at V-B is appropriate &amp; there's a museum. Money can be better spent #QandA
@QandA every family had a same sex loving person.
The ANZAC legend is a distinctly white male tale. Is it still as relevant in a multicultural Australia? #foodforthought #qanda
If you don't believe in marriage equality. You don't believe in equality in general. @QandA #qanda
And why is the Liberal Party taking instructions from Labor? #QandA
Seems that governments from both sides would prefer to spend $$$ commemorating dead veterans rather than helping those who are alive. #qanda
If your conscience doesn't support gay marriage then maybe you should buy a new conscience imo #qanda
Wonder if Bill knows what she is doing while he is away?  She is doing damage. #Qanda Shame on her. #Auspol #WApol  https://t.co/POJw2nzjdc
If it's against their conscience, their conscience is wrong. No more discrimination against SS couples that wish to marry #qanda
2015, things are changing faster than ever, obviously  #qanda
Maybe Labor should allow MPs to abstain rather than vote against? #QandA
Tanya has it right. Either the party as a whole supports discrimination or it doesn't. #auspol #qanda #marriagequality
I hate the fact that politicians get to choose the fate of #marriageequality. #qanda
This is not an issue of a vote.  This is an issue of the left faction trying to throw people out of the party #qanda
#QandA We are equal in most ways. Be proud of that and let the next generation sort out the rest!
the "slow and cautious plan" bluntly is to wait for the over 60s to pass away #qanda
Liberals turning against SSM because Labor is turning towards it? How short-sighted! #qanda
#qanda #GoTanya @tanya_plibersek "we don't support discrimination" #marriagequality @QandA

Why slow and cautious? How long do these people have to wait? #QandA

Can we repeal the marriage act and get govt out of our love lives? #qanda
Marriage equality is still a great inequality in this country. Catch up, get it together Australia. #qanda #gaymarriage
Tony Abbott doesn't want to be the PM who let gays get married. That's why it's going nowhere. #qanda
No matter how outdated, MPs, and all people, are entitled to their opinions. #qanda @QandA
Can't believe that in 2015, gay marriage is still not legal in Australia #QandA #UJCOMM2657

#QandA Sinodinos straight from ICAC to Q &amp; A
Time for a conscience vote on marriage equality!!! #qanda
I imagine that there'll be ALP MPs who'll be grateful for a binding position #qanda
If most of Australia support same sex marriage why can't our elected representatives support it #qanda
Because its an abbottopoly #qanda
Deciding on whether it is right to discriminate against one group over another is sensible @QandA #qanda
This consience thingy could be applied to refugee policy. #QandA
The #QandA crowd must hate the fact hundreds of thousands of people turned out for #AnzacDay commemorations across the country
I applaud @tanya_plibersek wanting to make #MarriageEquality binding ALP policy. Great leadership shown wanting to end discrimination #QandA
Politicians are already behind what their constituents already believe. Society is moving towards equality, not away. #QandA
i support #marriageequality #qanda
Claims that Plibersek's move will affect internal Lib politics seem pretty far fetched IMO. If it is true, it's bizarre reasoning. #qanda
A conscience vote on marriage equality may be good politics but it is poor principle. #QandA
So Arthur, even this will be Labor's fault? #qanda #marriageequality
It's 2015... Why is same-sex marriage still a debate #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Ohhhh biff  #qanda
@MKPS001 @QandA errrr I'm pretty sure they're different things. What would you have done differently?
Tanya is my spirit animal #qanda
@qanda #qanda Oh &amp; this same sex marriage discussion is far more important than looking after our war veterans and TPI pensioners #NOT
If you @tanya_plibersek ever lose one of those earrings you have on qanda tonight may I have the other one?! I lost one just like those! :)
I can't believe #MarriageEquality is still being debated. Australia; seriously behind the 8 ball #QandA
#QandA we will one day look back at #marriagequality with shame like we do on #womensrights and #racialdiscrimination @QandA
"people freely able to express themselves" except the gays, they can't express themselves #qanda
I thought all liberals had the right to vote any way they wanted? #qanda
Who cares what politicians want, let's put the question to a referendum  #qanda
The rights of same-sex couples isn't like the tooth fairy, it's not something you can choose to believe in or not. #qanda
Is right right and left wrong? #qanda
Abbott to blame Labor for gay marriage. #QandA
One's conscience can be consulted as to whether or not to apply for a same-sex marriage licence not whether the option should exist. #qanda
#auspol #qanda LABOR WERE IN POWER FOR 6 YEARS WITH MAJORITY IN BOTH HOUSES SO WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING IN EQUAL MARRIAGE ??? HYPOCRITES
Is there anything that isn't Labor's fault Arthur? #QandA
What happened to the promises of the candidates pre elected? #QandA
@tanya_plibersek I haven't been a supporter of yours, but can't agree with you more in regards to marriage equality. Thank you #qanda
#QandA this should be a referendum and not decided by a few people
You give a conscience vote about the death penalty or euthanasia. You dont need a conscience vote about getting married. #qanda
How did George Cistanza get a gig?! Elaine would have been better #qanda
Don't politicians spend a whole bunch of time supporting what they don't believe in? #qanda
It's beyond embarrassing. Aus soon to be behind Catholic Ireland. #qanda
#qanda incredible that LNP international decisions are the ALPs fault! When a supernova explodes across the galaxy, they must blame ALP.
@veganblue imagine if a LABOR MP "Can Not Recall" like $inodino$ ?   #Newscorpse would implode!   #qanda #ICAC #AUSPOL
I bet if the industrialists &amp; weapons makers were made to sacrifice as equally as soldiers &amp; families are we'd never know another war #qanda
Love ya work Tanya #qanda
#qanda Arthur's thinking is very convoluted on the issue of marriage equality. What does he really think?
Why do you have to BELIEVE in the love between me &amp; my partner? My love for @RiaCSantos is NOT a unicorn!!! Seriously. #qanda
My question is how much Arthur Sinodinos is getting paid for tonight's appearance? Is it $20 million? #ICAC #qanda
just shut up and let people get married you bastards !! #qanda
#qanda I think its time for new blood in the parliament ! Get rid of all old fossils !!
There's a fabulous amount of support for #ScottMcIntyre but has anyone offered him a job ? @mcintinhos ? #QandA
#QandA  I wonder if it is the macho Union men who are homophobic and disagree with gay marriage
This shouldn't even be discussed. It's about equality. One's preference of partner has nothing to do with you. #qanda #ujcomm2657
Are we in danger of using the conscience vote when all else fails? #qanda
#QandA Ain't politicians elected to exercise their conscience? Ain't all matters including #marriagequality should be a conscience vote?
Love is love. Why continue supporting legal discrimination? #qanda
#qanda I hope McIntyre sues SBS for wrong full dismissal.
#qanda The govt can only legislate on civil law - it cannot compel the Churches to marry same-sex couples - why maintain civil inequality?
Awesome Tony. Point out to Arthur that LNP object to things because ALP support them. Not on merit of issue #qanda
#qanda how much of that $430m paid for pollies and partners to travel all around the world on my taxes again.
political parties should not be voting based on only their own opinions, they are voting for everyone in our country #qanda
@qanda Are we the same race that is aiming to send people to Mars yet we're debating marriage equality? #qanda #stopdiscrimination
@tanya_plibersek for PM #marriagequality #equality #auspol #qanda
Who cares about a politicians conscience? should be a referendum for society to decide #marriagequality #qanda
Politicians are too used to an "unconscious" vote to think about a conscious vote #qanda
#qanda I'm all for marriage equality, but I still won't make someone vote against what they believe in. No one has that right.
Can we just remove all the extras surrounding it. This is a plain and simple step forward on EQUALITY. #justdoit  #qanda
#Qanda Sounds like a question for a national referendum at the next federal election. #letthepeopledecide
Marriage discrimination? What about discrimination against kids forced to miss out on a parent? #qanda
@qanda #MarriageEquality is way overdue! Conscious votes are not working. Party members need to follow party policy!!
One persons founding story is another's foucauldian nightmare #qanda
Sinodinos - don't skew the ideas: Pollies represent voters, not Unions. #QandA
We are going to have to explain this discrimination to our children. Australia needs to catch up, this is a disgrace. #qanda
Discrimination is unconciable  #QandA
There are more than 17 countries supporting same sex marriage, why hasn't Australia? #qanda
@Alohaviola1 Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  #QandA
Marriage equality is not a matter of conscience @TonyJones_qanda #qanda
Bees are on the what now? Exsqueeze me? Bacon powder? #qanda
It's better for Labor to gain thousands of progressive voters and lose a dozen or 2 RWNJs than the other way around #qanda
@blockish7 single use items. That's all they are. Typical RW ideology #qanda
Can't believe they bring #Religion into the gay marriage debate. Religion is a redundant notion in the 21st century #auspol #qanda
People don't want to be forced to vote for something they don't believe in? Wow. Would never have guessed. #qanda
It's time for #marriageequality a Labor binding vote and a coalition conscience is inline with both parties principle #qanda
#qanda The Liberal Party Leadership has to know what @AustralianLabor are doing so they can make sure they BLAME LABOR
...how do you know what goes on in the liberal party room? Out of interest? #qanda
We need much more than "discussion" from the conservatives on #marriagequality and "due course" isn't good enough @QandA
Ms plibersek is my idol #qanda
Not one of our soldiers fought for #FreedomOfSpeech. Not one. #AnzacDay #qanda
I'd prefer that $430M to be spent on a non-road. #qanda
This is easily the worst #qanda ever. Complete waste of a panel. Half an hour on the Bali 9. No one holding Sinodinos to account.
Who does it hurt if two people get married. #qanda
You're not elected to vote according to your conscience, you're elected to vote according to your constituents wishes! #qanda
Boys, mum and me watching #qanda c/w lively discussion.  #marriagequality
ANZAC's must stick together, except on issues of discriminating against same-sex couples it seems.  #qanda
@QandA @tanya_plibersek it's about time  #marriagequality #shame #AustralianLiberal  #gayrights #humanrights
Conscience votes in the Labor Party are a rare thing cos it takes so long to find their conscience. #QANDA
slippery sinodinos has been forced onto #qanda by the liberal party to try and boost his image... wot a fuccin stooge...
Twitter is a place of Free Speech so now we are being spied on and could be sacked if we speak our truth. #auspol #qanda
Why can't our friends and colleagues get married, just because of their sexuality (a private matter)? #qanda
#qanda have a referendum.
How can contemporary politicians NOT believe in freedom to marry, or otherwise, regardless of gender? #QandA
Who cares what the politicians think. Let's have a national vote it's called a referendum #QandA
@QandA  #QandA you found his tweets offending? #freespeech I didn't. ..truth is always hard to read
Support for Tanya's clear and calm delivery on #qanda tonight
@QandA The is no war memorial for every aboriginal killed defending their home land since 1789, best for most here to stay in denial
#qanda Hahahaha, as if you politicians already don't vote for things you don't believe in.
Great. That's what I need. More weddings #qanda
You could use adjectives, e.g. Christian marriage and secular marriage. #QandA
Marriage equality should be taken to a referendum. #qanda
Are we really still discussing marriage equality laws? Just do it!!! #qanda
@qanda #qanda seems Tony Jones would argue there should be a conscience vote on slavery
Thank you Tanya #QandA
Ohhhhh... 'Trust us. It's sorting itself out.' (Like women getting through to Liberal leadership?) #qanda
Do any of these people give a shit? #qanda why hasn't it happened before now?
@dailebree hahahaha ewwww but funny   qanda
The LNP really should not try to get on some sort of high horse about this issue. The LNP don't even have a high horse to be honest. #qanda
Tony Abbott has a hard time having female equality, how can it be expected he'll have gay equality? #QandA
Marriage equality - it's time!! #QandA
"This is legal discrimination." #qanda
Married At First Sight erodes the institution of marriage, not marriage equality. It's time to enshrine human equality #qanda
So the Liberals would be against conscience vote because ALP decided to be in favour of same sex marriage? Kindergarten stuff. #QandA
We have had a slow and steady approach and its causing people in our society to experience prolonged discriminstion #qanda #auspol #equality
@newscomauHQ @tomporteous @QandA as though Japan weren't committing war crimes?
#qanda @qanda conscience vote rubbish, represent your constituents you pollies!!!!!
@MariamVeiszadeh "when  nothing  is debatable Everything is controversial  " #McIntyre #qanda
Ridiculous that Plibersek set the cause back. Just plain Conservative panic that a progressive law might pass. #qanda
majority of Australians are pro gay marriage and parliamentarians are there to represent the Australian people. Why isn't it legal? #qanda
@QandA @tanya_plibersek you are killing it today! Thank you for speaking up against discrimination!
Good on you Tanya you have moved us into the 21st century and the audience clap you for it. Ignore sinodinos and shop steward.  #qanda
@QandA I'm sincerely sorry Tanya, but a conscience vote is the only answer. Just as one consciously chooses to live their life.
Believe in?? Conscience votes?? If you just VOTED as per your actual constituents we'd have marriage equality tomorrow. #QandA
Why should ALP MPs be made to vote for equality? Because it's the right thing to do. #QandA
Wait, so the ALP can point fingers but not question itself for 6 years of inaction on marriage equality #qanda
I'm done, can't take this shit anymore. What an absolute shocker of a show. Man up Turnbull &amp; fix this treachery! #qanda
Carbon-neutral diesel is now a reality. Audi have made diesel fuel from carbon dioxide and water http://t.co/vmfklccE7H @MikeHudema #qanda

Well said @tanya_plibersek #QandA
Sinodinos just showed the weird and twisted ways Liberal blames Labor #marriagequality #qanda
#qanda racism, sexism, ageism are not "matters of conscience" - discrimination is wrong @qanda
Marriage equality is not a politcal issue; it is a social issue made into a political issue. Do we want to continue to discriminate? #QandA
Arthur Sinodinos - absolute lies. Pure and simple. #qanda #ScottMcIntyre
Lots of same sex love in the trenches. Gay marriage in the name of ANZAC #qanda
To have a conscious vote you need to have a conscious #qanda
If gay relationships are treated as couples for tax purposes the government needs to recognise them #qanda
MPs shouldn't be voting according to their personal beliefs, they should represent their electors #qanda
Yassssss @tanya_plibersek !! #qanda
So, Arthur, it's the ALP's fault if the Libs don't pursue marriage equality? FFS! #qanda
Even among her skulking, sneering, Labor peers Plibersek stands out as exceptionally smug, fake. Quite an achievement. #QandA
#QandA @QandA If Dean Smith's theory is true,then he &amp; Turnbull should grow a spine, stare Bernardi, Abetz, etc in the eye &amp; cross the floor
It's rational and fair policy against discrimination. #qanda
I love Tanya Plibersek. She should be Labor leader #qanda
#qanda Labor running the country from opposition? Sounds like it.
#qanda if we want equality why force people to vote for 1 or another- vote for what you have been elected to represent???
The inability of a gay Australian to marry denies them of a basic legal right which dilutes the value of their vote. So undemocratic #qanda
@FuriousFong  Tanya has set back this cause and this mistake will haunt her as she  gets the knife out for Bill. #qanda
This #qanda is a vehicle to reintroduce Sinodinus into the political discourse... What a total farce...
There is a bound vote on one side, &amp; conscience vote on the other, now. Why can't there be again, but this time bound in favour? #qanda
$5 million for humanitarian relief to Nepal-, 1/20th of the cost of the new memorial in France - remember our responsibilities too #qanda

God I love Tanya Plibersek #qanda
If the LNP are so worried, have the conscience vote before July's ALP meeting #qanda
Gutless Tories blame @tanya_plibersek to distract from their failure to budge #marriagequality debate within their caucus.  #qanda
#qanda Arthur speaking as he sees it tonight. Does anybody else in the Coalition have the courage to step up?
"Don't believe in" - FFS! I don't need you to believe in me and my life. #qanda
The idea Labor should have a conscience vote so the Liberals adopt one is rubbish. It's been 4 years and nothing has changed. #qanda
Well, we wouldn't allow racism or sexism or bigotry, because they are bred from hate. Where is gay marriage bred from? Love. #qanda
#qanda  bit late plib I'm over marriage equality  its hetronormative  the greens also beat you to it..
#QandA This legal right harms no one but enhances the lives of a number
The ALP had no trouble getting a binding vote on marriage in 2004. #qanda
Asphincter says what? #qanda
Channel 9 can marry strangers without the sanctity if marriage being questioned. It's time for gay marriage in Australia #qanda
Why is marriage a law anyway?  #qanda
Problem- how many MPs can exercise their conscience? #asylumseekers #FirstNations #qanda
labor is a stalinist party. toe the line #qanda
We need a day where we recognise, remember and feel compassion for those who lost their lives in ALL wars #qanda
The ALP conscience vote on #marriageequality is an anomaly and long overdue to be scrapped. #QANDA
How about all those homeless LGBT youth turned away/abused from shelters #qanda
Elected member have to represent the views of majority of their constituents #QandA
Other people's rights shouldn't be up to the conscience of a set of politicians. #QandA
What about the legal right of a child to have a mum and a dad Tanya? #QandA
@QandA #qanda  we are not second class citizens
Hear, hear @tanya_plibersek #qanda #auspol
The real issue here is that parties choose how your MP votes. Not you. #qanda
Marriage equality is going to happen. It is accepted by society. It's only a matter of time before pollies &amp; lawmakers catch up #qanda
Would love to have seen a conscience vote in the LNP when they were voting away a price on carbon dioxide pollution... #qanda @SouBundanga
We need more variety of consciousnesses in our government, not just conservative @qanda @QandA
This is a categorical moral imperative #qanda
#QandA people aligned. "With the shoppies union" Arthur Sinodinos are under cover DLP people.
Take it to the people. Politicians have failed the public they are supposed to tepresent  #QandA
#marriageequality will only come to a vote when it's certain to fail. Too embarrassing for the PM to be rolled on it #qanda
It's discrimination. Plain and simple. Thank you, Tanya. #qanda
Could we be watching the future leader of the Australian Labor Party? #qanda
The Whitlam Labor government had a conscience vote when they introduced no-fault divorce via the Family Law Act.  #QandA

#marriagequality will not be achieved thru coercion - it will be more defensible if achieved thru free will. It's called democracy. #qanda
I believe in euthanasia for Arthur #qanda

Depriving a child of a mother should be on principle rejected by both parties. #qanda

@QandA #qanda #marriagequality Yay Tanya!  Equality under the law is NOT optional!
What?  Gay marriage mocks the institution of marriage.  Just like #Channel9?  #qanda
Our law should be based on equality of rights for all. Marriage equality will arrive - let's make it NOW. #qanda
Tell 'em, @tanya_plibersek ! #qanda
Tanya Plibersek would be a far better Labor leader than "Abbott-lite" Shorten. Just sayin' #qanda
#MarriageEquality is a #HumanRight That's why Australia is struggling with it #asylumseekers #GenderEquality etc  #qanda
Um, The Intervention, Tanya? Maybe you've heard of it. #qanda
@tanya_plibersek is my new favourite politician. So many good points. #qanda
Sinodinos refers to openly gay colleague as a good friend: you don't make friends with #marriagequality? #QandA
Tanya is slinging way too much logic. How does she understand discrimination so well.... #QandA
This is an idiot, so we can't show you her face on the radio. But apparently #QandA can't get enough of the dickhead  http://t.co/qvmXoRBT2U
We should look after our living veterans $430, 000 now that is a disgrace #qanda
Both parties spend way too much time spent working out how to react to things the other side does instead of actual doing #qanda
This is legal discrimination preventing one group in our society from the social recognition of their relationships @tanya_plibersek #qanda
Is Tanya Plibersek a gay icon yet? #qanda
The lefty attack on ANZACS just another iconic institition they trying to degrade for their own selfish misguided socialist agenda #qanda
Members of ALP who are opposed are free to reanimate the corpse of the DLP. #Qanda
@QandA #qanda why is there legal age discrimination on age for sexual consent? @tanya_plibersek
"people in the shoppies' union won't vote Labor" ... George. come on. #QandA
#Qanda marriage is another lable... if we all just Loved then nobody would be trying to force anything
I agree with @tanya_plibersek You don't get a conscious vote on racism or sexism... #qanda
Dare I say Tanya would be a good PM. Compared to Tony Abbott, 1000 x better #QandA
When most of the population wants it to happen what right do you have to deny it #qanda
Tanya is 100% spot on #qanda
Same sex marriage will happen regardless #QandA

Marriage inequality is discrimination. Plain and simple. It's time for change in the @LiberalAus Party #qanda
The gay marriage debate needed a public kick along, savvy politics today has achieved that. And on #QandA day with Plibersek no less!
#qanda Bali drug dealers, Money Nepal, what about 1.3 million Australians with no access to rehab with ice epidemic - unbelievable

Tanya, where is the same compassion for asylum seekers? #qanda
#qanda #marriagequality Why are people so worried about who is married to whom? Marriage is a relationship between 2 ppl, that's all.
I don't mind @tanya_plibersek's explanation of why a conscience vote is not required #qanda #marriagequality
#qanda Pilbersek just killed Shorten

Tanya's right, why should a section of the community be discriminated against? #qanda
Just after the start of #QandA tonight, some news came through that a new court hearing may take place on May... http://t.co/6VQLeEIPY1

So true. What this consensus shit? Its a human right - don't deny it #qanda
It's just not safe to speak against same sex marriage. Freedom of speech? Only if it's aligned to populist opinion #qanda

Why are people only worried about Christians in the Middle East, rather than, you know, people in general? #qanda
ISIS don't really discriminate. They kill Muslims too #qanda
Agree with Sinodinos. When speaking under the logo of one's employer, discretion must be exerted. Under one's own banner, up to you. #qanda
The greatest harm comes from the best intentions  #qanda
Don't let people be killed, whether Christian or not. Simple. #QandA
#qanda @tanya_plibersek doing pretty good job of auditioning for @AustralianLabor leadership. Not a zinger in sight. #auspol
#qanda Plibersek doesn't want ALP conscience vote cos she knows numbers aren't there. And after all the abuse of Abbott over same thing
#qanda unfortunately being Christian doesn't equate to having oil
Huge question #QandA
Yes, Christianity is an ancient culture,  what a great question! #qanda
Sadly fighting ISIS is a just war, just as fighting Hitler was. #qanda
You don't have a vote about sexism but you do have a vote about women's rights. #qanda
What's happening in the Middle East to EVERYONE is an absolute nightmare. #qanda
I hope they allow gay marriage just so I can stop hearing about it on #qanda
How can you go from discussing something so interesting to something so boring. Who cares who marries who? @QandA
#qanda Arthur Sinodinos, no one expects YOU to marry a fellow male. Settle down &amp; focus on some real issues. Traumatized kids in detention.
Plibersek for PM! @qanda #qanda
Support the Kurds on the ground, they are our best change against ISIS  #qanda
And the winner of best religious costume on #qanda is ...
Tanya could do a better job of explaining it to simpletons, but it's a no-brainer. It is discrimination #QandA
The answer to religious conflict is obvious. End religion. #qanda
If you dont want gay marriage dont gay marry #qanda
ah i think we'll find there are actually quite a few examples of conscious votes apart from life / death #qanda
Another reason to thank the #ANZACs for doing their bit to shape middle east into what it is today #qanda
Freedom of speech -&gt; freedom to employ/sack -&gt; freedom of public discourse. And no-one has been shot in the process #ScottMcIntyre #QandA
Tanya Plibersek on #marriagequality and why it should not be a conscience vote #qanda http://t.co/krXnHFk8uV
#qanda if the labor party is against same sex marriage, I'm in favour of Tanya Plibersek 'compelling' her party to vote for it. #WayOverdue
#qanda Democratic not to have a conscience vote of course.
It is not funny to have joke questioners on #qanda

#qanda How dare anyone shake the ANZAC myth so beloved of "Reclaim Australia" and neo nationalists.
We can just refer to what Dr. Holbrook said earlier. War crimes are all about context right? #qanda
Pretty sure no one is safe in the Middle East, whether your Muslim, Christian, Jew. #qanda
Friendly reminder: #marriagequality #qanda http://t.co/zoebQ3c9FU

The situation in the Middle East is why war is still necessary - barbarians will not reason, they must be fought #qanda
It's 2015 and some people won't allow other humans equality because they find it icky. #QandA
Just be thankful that we live in a country where we won't be beheaded for our views #qanda
Great question @BishopSuriel #qanda
With incredible grace and impeccable class @tanya_plibersek shuts down devil's advocate @TonyJones_qanda #qanda #auspol
The problems in the Middle East will likely never end. #qanda
ALL religious zealots are guilty and have blood on their hands throughout history! #QandA
Christians did the same thing a few hundred years ago... #QandA
The brief interlude into a conversation about #marriageequality feels almost cheery in comparison to the rest of tonight's #qanda
I think TJones interrupted @tanya_plibersek as she was explaining why to move from a conscience vote? Very odd to interrupt and reask #qanda
Tania Plibersek is just so rational &amp; well spoken. Smart too. If only more politicians were more like her than our Yabba Dabba Doo PM #qanda
So glad we devoted 2 minutes to same-sex marraige and 20+ minutes to debating ANZAC Day. #qanda

Disturbed to hear kids and adults vox-popped on radio saying the Anzacs in Gallipoli were defending Australia? Really?? #AnzacDay #qanda
#qanda Middle East hmmm why don't we stop bombing them that might be a good start
Web Question: Why are you compelling marriage equality party line? @tanya_plibersek responds #QandA http://t.co/TiFXk6hiD3
Pls read this article. Makes you question the role of military, also the nature of rape. http://t.co/CRFKEDC9t8 #qanda #ujcomm2657
this appears to be Tanya Plibersek opposing future prime minister Malcolm Turnbull rather than PM Tony Abbott. #qanda #auspol
Marriage inequality is no different to racism, ageism, sexism and the like. It is discrimination. #QandA #ujcomm2657
Odd thing: the politicians who refuse to budge on "freedoms" always find a reason to object to "marriage equality" ??? #qanda
So if a conscience vote is about life and death issues then also have one about the treatment of asylum seekers by both major parties #qanda
Protecting Christians in the Middle East is not our responsibility. Aiding all people everywhere, maybe #qanda
#qanda One famous Labor politician had position on SSM which was completely dictated by shoppos.Just be honest &amp; vote with TRUE conscience.
The situation in the Middle East has compounded thanks to Western intervention #qanda
#QandA I wonder what the world would be like without religion causing wars?
"Religion poisons everything" Christopher Hitchens #qanda
#KCA #VoteJKT48ID GetUp: Marriage inequality is discrimination. Plain and simple. It's time for change in the LiberalAus Party #qanda
Go Tanya. You rock #marriageequality  @QandA
Australia needs an Ambassador for Global Human Rights #qanda
Dont believe eht you hear on tv! Live is all that exists!!! Ask the universe.... #qanda
That said, Christians are among the religious/ethnic groups being persecuted heavily. To dismiss it is to go against humanity. #qanda
#qanda No one deserves to be persecuted, whether they're Christian or not.
I like the orthodox priest, but in all honesty Australia doesn't have a great record protecting ancient cultures #qanda
That's right. The situation in the Middle East is terrible. Everyday the West makes it worse. #qanda
Concerning Australian doctor joining ISIS #qanda
#qanda Muslims and Christians are being slaughtered. Why single out Christians.
Why r we still talking about marriage equality,  just do it,  people should be able to marry who they love regardless of gender #qanda
#qanda Our government calls the Kurdish women fighting ISIS terrorists. Women defending their families !
If it's not about glorification of war why do so many RSL clubs adorn their entrances with huge guns once used to kill? #qanda
The situation in the Middle East has always been terrible. We just didn't notice before the need for oil arose #QandA
#qanda Tania as PM as PM and Tim Fisher as Deputy
@sinclair_josh absolutely ! Could not agree more. As usual @tanya_plibersek is all class &amp; what our party is about. #marriagequality #qanda
Could someone ask Tom his thoughts on our refugee camps? @qanda #qanda
#Qanda What is going on in the Middle East, it seems like half a world away from us!
People should be free to believe what they like in safety. No matter how ludicrous their beliefs are. #qanda
TanyaPlibersek sounds like she believes ALP caucus decisions are God like. There should be a conscience vote on all issues. #QandA
ISIS fighters think they won't go to heaven if they die from a female's bullet. Just send Women into the middle East! #QandA #AusPol @QandA
That someone who opposes a conscience vote is openly gay does not give their position more weight. #qanda

Fighting #marriagequality makes you look like a dick. Just sayin #qanda
When is the ALP having a conscience vote on its refugee policy?  #qanda
Australia needs to get its own house in order before we go trying to influence religious or social injustice in the Middle East #qanda
#qanda an international conception of human rights has a long way to go, but both the west and east concepts of human rights exist.
Tom Porteus says "the situation in the Middle East is absolutely terrible".  Now, who made it so through their excursions for oil...? #qanda
#qanda well done @tanya_plibersek for clearly explaining the criteria by which issues should be considered for a conscience vote.
#Qanda isis is israel ..
@JaneCaro Mmmm! Even old Chuckie Wales became all maudlin as he was reading out loud at the 'Big Gig' #qanda

Why is the religious pressures against gay marriage still influencing 2015 politics and policies? #qanda
Heteros don't need to prove they love each other before they marry, so why should homos have to? #qanda
By my count, ABC have just broadcast their 3rd tweet praising the question. We get it. You love yourself. #Qanda
The best way to get MPs to support #marriagequality is to tell them a no vote means they are on #TeamBernardi #WillPassTomorrow #qanda
@newscomauHQ @tanya_plibersek @QandA
Will Human Rights Watch challenge the AU gov re our refugee concentration camps? #qanda @qanda

#qanda Why should the personal preferences of politicians on gay marriage be relevant? They're supposed to govern for us.
Tanya Plibersek shows that politicians don't have to be petty partisan sloganeers. She's calm, intelligent and nuanced. More please #qanda
How many suicides of non-heterosexual youths does it take until equality is considered a matter of life and death? #MakeItStop #QandA
@QandA Seriously, how did a good ANZAC conversation end up about marriage equality?

*yawns* Another episode of @QandA, same topics discussed.. #qanda
#qanda terrible? @GreenJ said it will be a non issue after 12 months....that's in about 3 months time, so all's going to be good, no worries
Religion! Huuah! What is it good for? Absolutely nothing. #qanda
Putting it out there, the Bishop's sceptre is pretty cool #qanda
ISIS stated aim is to take over the world ... even now I think we're underestimating the threat #qanda
If you don't like the way your MP votes on #marriagequality vote him/her out. Simple. #qanda
#qanda Religion will keep wars going, human rights will excuse them. Libs will blame Labor
The only way we can know what to do about ISIS is by talking to them. #QandA
Arab Spring #WinterIsComing #qanda
Liberal position on marriage equality (and everything else) boils down to "If Labor supports it, we don't!" #qanda
Once again people on @QandA pretends that racism is not running rampant in Australian society. @abcnews is sanitising as well
#qanda this Twitter feed is so distracting!
How much of the $430m was expended on this embarrassment? #qanda http://t.co/7TJsiGmApD
not even joking i really need to wee right now and i have consumed a bottle of white wine #qanda
@QandA #QandA Violence in the name of religion or doctrine goes against what most Australians associate with being religious
ISIS needs to be shut down. However violence cannot be resolved with violence. #qanda

#QandA The right for gay &amp; lesbians to freely marry each other shouldn't be voted on, it's something that should be given. #MarriageEquality

It's completely up to SBS whether or not to bow into the pressure from Malcolm Turnbull's office. It's an internal matter. #qanda

Yes, Coptic Christians are a minority. No, they are not the only victims of conflict. #qanda

Pretty sure no one is safe in the Middle East, whether you're Muslim, Christian, Jew. #qanda
No good can come of war. #qanda
#QandA if Isis turned up on our door they would be shut down in a minute what's taking the world so long to get rid of these terrorists
#qanda I can answer that- same way we watch Isis killing and beheading Muslims...
@QandA ISIS soldiers take hallucinogenic drugs before they do beheadings.

Unfortunately we can't defeat ISIS with bombs #qanda
western countries don't care, Kurdish militias are the ones fighting ISIS and they're still classed as terrorists #qanda
Why should straight ppl control what others can/can't do? Makes as much sense as a male Minister for Women #qanda
So just who is fighting ISIS not us not the USA.....why #qanda
#HumanRights are not an optional extra. #qanda
It seems that the Gitmo torture mentality of the Coalition of the Willing is really coming back to bite on them on the bum.  #qanda
LibLabs only ALLOW people to use their conscience rarely. Time to vote for reps who use their conscience EVERY SINGLE TIME #auspol #qanda
Feel like I've heard these Tim Fischer rants before #qanda http://t.co/a7axLouKmq
#QandA It was really a bad thing to say that the bombs were terrist attacks, don't say what isn't true
Thank god for #qanda for focusing on things other than whether Bruce Jenner wants to be a man or a woman

#qanda what about focusing on Australia's scourge of domestic violence and the daily war that many Australian women face every day
#qanda we need to secularise all religion. It is a families duty not a governments.
"Human rights are absolutely central to what is going on here"- couldn't agree more @tomporteous #QandA #ujcomm2657
thank you @tomporteous for trying to explain a very difficult and ill-informed area #qanda @QandA
gee, what changed your mind on the War in Iraq, Arfur? #qanda
No #TPP questions this week either. Damn #qanda
The dictators are STILL THERE @QandA
@KieraGorden I don't watch #qanda these days. I get more fun from just reading the tweets
#qanda the persecution of Christians in the Middle East has nothing to do with the West and everything to do with ISLAM.
#qanda How fortunate the world is to have someone such as @tomporteous in it.
"Grubbanax: http://t.co/S0rqGIY8Hy Why wasn't #WarOnTerror focused on #SaudiArabia? #QandA Qanda?? #ISIS born out of #US help.
#qanda ISIS is a direct consequence of western intervention in eastern nations.
It's [relatively] easy to chase terrorists, how do you change the ideology? #qanda
.@wolfcat I am straight and I'd vote for gay marriage. Why shouldn't gays suffer the same as straights?  #equality  #qanda
#qanda the issue: ISIS sees its cause as that of counter-violence (against the violence wrought by the West) rather than terrorism
All countries ruled by religion are pits of despair #QandA
How can we stop ISIS from killing people - has anyone thought to ask them? #QandA
We cling to stoneage concepts like 'religion'...and worse, we fight about which is 'right'?! It's amazing we can feed ourselves #QandA
This conscience vote diversion will probably delay marriage equality yet again.  The Libs would be loving it.  #qanda
The Arab Spring happened entirely because of America's meddling in the Middle East, Arthur, you fool. #qanda
So, so many wars. Hard to keep them all straight, yeah? #qanda
We created SIS #qanda
He's dead right. 911 could have been wests high ground democratic moment - we blew it #qanda

In a lot of ways, religion and previous incidents from outsiders has formed the instability in the Middle East today #qanda #ujcomm2657
Sadly, we have to ask ourselves - is the world in a better place than it was in 1914? #QandA
ISIS would have happened sooner or later regardless of any action on The West's part. #qanda

ISIS is a direct result of the invasion of Iraq #Qanda
#qanda let not forgot ISIS have killed more Muslims than Christians.
The west definitely should be blamed #qanda
@Ubermich good dock - send in the women #qanda
#qanda There are many historians who question the need to bomb Japan.  They were war crimes.
#QandA Tim is being so rude, turning away from (Tom talking) and showing his distain for anyone who is against war
Maybe we should approach a middle east policy in which we actually stick around long enough after the shooting stops to help rebuild #qanda
#QandA Explain all the Toyota land cruisers.
Which dictator "fell" in Syria? #qanda
#qanda thank you Tanya for reframing the marriage equality debate
That was feeble, Sinodinos. #qanda
As the U.S. deals with their legacy of torture, Australia will deal with its legacy of its treatment of asylum seekers.  #QandA
We are reaping what we sowed in the Middle East in 2001. #QandA
The West needs to get out of the Middle East. #Renewables development = no dependence on oil #auspol #qanda
Wish ISIS had no access to social media to promote themselves #qanda
Tom Porteous makes an excellent point about ISIS growing (in part) out of the violent context of Western 'interventions'. #qanda
I wonder if Mr Sinodinos still thinks it was a good idea to start a war in Iraq? #qanda
The allies knew the Japanese were going to surrender but they bombed them anyway. #qanda #auspol
We will need to go to war in the Middle East again in eight years time, then after that we will return in eight more years! #qanda
No Assad didn't fall that's kind of the point bro #qanda
Sinodinos doesn't believe anyone should be held responsible for anything, apparently. #QandA #auspol
Which regime fell in Syria, Arthur? #QandA
Whaa? Tony Jones never gets confused. It's clearly been a big week. #qanda #ujcomm2657
The West should ABSOLUTELY be blamed for a lot of what is happening in the Middle East. #qanda
Here we go, this wank is gonna blame US for ISIS. well done dick head. What an applause whore for a lefty audience. #qanda #auspol

#qanda these countries have been fighting for centuries.  The problem is that it's.Now spread to here. Level Syria like Hiroshima.
Every Australian should thank their lucky stars they are living in the "Lucky Country" still! #QandA
Could media be a further driver for these beheadings and terror?  Now more than ever? #qanda
#QandA HRW Porteous tells it as it is. Terrorist Criminals also exist in Western Powers yet to be brought to #justice who arms ISIS ?
Wish someone declares war on men's violence a/g women  119 Aussies killed since 1915 by terrorism   106 women murdered since 2014 #qanda

Arab Spring was caused by #Wikileaks and #Climatechange #qanda

The lack of progress in Islam is why the Middle East is the terrible mess that it is. It is not the fault of the West. #qanda
...did I just hear that correctly? That the West isn't responsible for the rise of extremist groups? #qanda
Well said, Arthur Sinodinos #qanda
#Qanda  Did Sinodinos advise Howard to go into Iraq?
Religion drives ISIS and most Middle East conflict  #qanda
America and the west has been meddling in the Middle East since World War 1 and before. #qanda
Ahhhh $inodini$ lays ALL the blame on arabs #QandA
@dasher39 and his scoff at Scott being called a journalist was sheer petulance. #qanda #ScottMcIntyre

Religion creates instability and war, it needs to go or be reformed. Islam needs a reformation like other religions. #qanda
The War on Terror has created more terror #qanda
People in the middle east have to take some responsibility for our invasions. #Qanda
Oh, Arthur, people in the Middle East ARE bloody well dealing with the crap your lot started in 2003. #qanda
The West is absolutely partly to blame for what has happened in the Middle East. #QandA
This guy is always shifting responsibility away. True politician #qanda
It's very convenient to not take responsibility for the Middle East, but you can't pretend we didn't create a power vacuum there. #qanda
"While mistakes were made, I don't think the West should be blamed for what's happened." Sinodinos #qanda @qanda http://t.co/oiMbLWoVux

#qanda isis doesnt exist.. its just a part of the new world order

of course it's our fault. what did we expect? bully these people and not expect retaliation? wake up. #qanda @qanda
#QandA at this rate with all the killings the Middle East will have no population
We went to war using a lie as an excuse. Just saying. #qanda

Should people in the Middle East take responsibility over allied drone strikes on civilians? #qanda
You can't pick and choose which terror you want to fight and which you want to ignore. Human rights are human rights. #QandA
Yeah the Middle East is just too complicated tbh also foreign intervention is not to blame #qanda
There are too many problems in the world. Is Australia butter spread over too much bread? #qanda
#qanda Its got us oil for food !!
We used Terror to fight the War on Terror. Something odd about that. #QandA

"the fact of the matter is..." please tell me more facts! #qanda
Maybe so many groups are angry at the West because we almost never take responsibility for anything #QandA
Western intervention is the last thing we need #qanda
@tanya_plibersek speaking the truth on @QandA We don't support discrimination #truelabor http://t.co/uPe1SPkgpG
Human rights are NOT a luxury #qanda
#ISIS was initially bankrolled by money from a Western ally: Saudi Arabia. #qanda
#QandA I agree the Middle East needs to take ownership of their issues and we (the U.S.) need to back off on trying to get more oil.
I have a theory that a Tanya Plibersek eye roll has enough kinetic energy to power the city of Melbourne for one year. #qanda

Send women soldiers to fight them they will either retreat or surrender as they believe if they are killed by a women they go to hell #qanda
sure thing. bombing the crap out of the middle east definitely didn't have anything to do with current problems #qanda

Fucking get a long-term plan, idiot. Stop bombing people on a fucking whim or greedy desire. #qanda
Sinodinos: PPL in a region shld take responsibility in that region. So accept refugees! #QandA
We, the west appointed those dictators #qanda

err, who supported dictators in the middle east for 40 years for cheap oil? #qanda
My cousin has 2 mums and is awesome so piss off with that argument omg #qanda
#QandA 'Turning back boats' in effect also support the terrorist by helping to punish their enemy.
Where does 'change' and moving foreword stop? What we view as heinous now could become the new hot minority group. #qanda
Arthur's right. We shouldn't be held even partly responsible for the consequences of our actions.  Shit happens.  #QandA
the war on terror has been as successful as the war on drugs #QandA
We seem to have forgotten those WMDs in Iraq #qanda
I think we bombed out on the War on Terror #qanda
Is that the government the US put in power Sinodinis. Oh that one.  #qanda
The West isn't responsible for issues in the Middle East? Now that's rewriting history #qanda

West created a vaccum and did nothing about it until 2007 rebuild process in IRAQ #QandA to late
Maybe the West should have drawn better lines and installed nicer dictators about 100 years ago - that would have solved it #qanda
#qanda Every time we deny Palestine we help feed organisations like ISIS. And we have a long history of Oil Wars in the Middle East
Holistic approach is needed. Terrorism is a global problem that needs a global solution.  #qanda
At what point do we just let the world be? Are we trying to become Team America? #qanda
$inodino$ reveals that Assad was toppled during the Arab Spring, live on #qanda. Does he know something the world, including Syria, doesn't?
The Iraq War really shouldn't have happened. #qanda
#qanda The 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq caused destabilisation of the Middle East

Isis and it's brother terrorist groups are comparable to the Nazis #QandA
Isis kills more Muslim's than Christians. #qanda

We are still trying to "teach" our values to cultures that totally reject them  #qanda
So far tonight USA death penaly, nuclear bombs on civilians and now torture in war on terror #qanda
Arthur talks about supporting the local Islamic people. Tony Abbott getting up on stage and calling them terrorists a bad idea, then? #qanda
The issue with IS is generations of young men who have grown up knowing nothing but war. No wonder their acts are so depraved. #qanda
So stay out of the Middle East completely then, fools, if it's a no-win situation. #qanda

Maybe if we hadn't persued Saddam for WMD which didn't exist, Isis wouldn't be were it is today. #qanda
The West's support for Israel doesn't help #qanda
Arthur not only sits on the fence, he builds a fence as he goes. #qanda
Would media be a further driver for these beheadings and terror?  Now more than ever? #qanda
Tanya Plibersek the calm voice of reason and humanity tonight #qanda
Can we actually get a Muslim on the panel to talk about the Muslim community? Sick of Middle aged white men talking for us #qanda
If only Eve didn't eat the apple, we wouldn't have terrorism or world wars #qanda
#qanda Arthur is not saying why leaders ousted in Middle East. The CIA/MOSSAD black ops are the chaos creators....
#qanda or the mass destruction weapons that didn't exist?
Oh Arthur, we've already passed that point  #QandA
Seriously ridonkulous that we have to leave the country we grew up in to get married #shamestraya #qanda #noh8 http://t.co/OiYdXr77VO
Sinodinos' ignorance about the middle east goes a long way to explaining how we blundered into war in Iraq in 2003 #qanda

#qanda "The fact of the matter is" political speak for this point is not negotiable, irrespective if the facts are wrong.
Equal nation status for Palestinians would help #qanda
Sadly the west did contribute to Middle East instability for many decades. #QandA
#QandA @QandA Yes, Arthur, inclusiveness HERE will help the crisis THERE.

I hope my kids will live in a world where same sex marriage is always deemed okay and legal... #ujcomm2657 #qanda

@QandA ice ice ice where's the assistance for families in crisis no rehabs for 14 year olds
Australia needs to focus on human rights says Sinodinos! #qanda
I wonder how long it will take for people to blame ISIS on ISIS. #qanda
Any war is the ultimate and utter breakdown of  fundamental human values and as such should never be celebrated #qanda
The greatest threat is competitive terrorist organizations trying to out-terror each other #qanda
"We need to maximise our inclusiveness with Muslims in our community"  - Sinodines  [and mean it] #qanda
#qanda Arthur and the LNP maximising inclusiveness by warning of home grown terrorists every single day.
ISIS comes partly from social n economic destabilisation and the West has done LOTS of that in the Middle East for decades #qanda
#qanda can everyone hear the DOUBLESPEAK / Cognitive dissonance from Sinodinous ? the guy is a professional liar
The only people who win in war are the rich. #qanda #auspol
Of course, we'd also have to spend that year in the shaaaaade. #qanda
On 9/11 two planes carrying 12 or so Muslims crashed into Twin towers People with something to gain told us it was Muslim's fault! #qanda

Arthur is spot on with his views tonight . @QandA #qanda
#QandA. The west happily supported Saddam during the Iran-Iraq war. Vacillating opportunism. Mike
Benjamin is nobody's friend. If Benjamin were an ice cream flavor, he'd be pralines and dick. #qanda
Is Arthur Sinodinous taking responsibility for John Howard's war based on lies? He was Howard's adviser at the time.  #qanda
Exactly. We can't sacrifice human rights to protect human rights. #QandA
The Middle East is turning into a giant mess. #qanda
I'd like to see a greater intake of any kind of refugees at this point. #qanda
Get rid of dependence on oil. No money = no power to oppress. Free renewable energies = better lives = less hate. #qanda
@Qanda #Qanda Why is it that the speech of LNP senior politicians especially is so very different from their actions? #auspol

That woman in the Barbara Bush blue suit wrote a book?! She must have a good editor #qanda
Saudi Arabia, the real terrorist state in the Middle East. But you know, the O word.... #qanda
#qanda So happy that Arthur's memory is working like a Swiss Watch.
@QandA @tanya_plibersek, we have real problems to deal with like Nepal's disaster.
@qanda The question was about the Christians in the Middle East
Why does it matter if they are Christian, all refugees are welcome #qanda
Refugees are not defined by their religion. #qanda
Sinodinis misses fact that UK US financed Saddam supplied WMDs to oppose Iran, despots eggging on despots #qanda
fuck off we're full #qanda
'Those elements in our Islamic communities that stand up against radicalism.' So, 99.99% of the communities. #qanda
LNP: "In the name of fighting terrorism we will take away your rights to protect you from those who would take away your rights." #qanda
When we give up our values, the terrorists have won #qanda
#qanda christian refugees....absolutely.
maybe you political party should stop radicalising people then, Arthur #qanda
So "we" don't support the death penalty under any circumstance but we're happy to send our troops to Middle East to kill baddies. #qanda
Whoa! Treating people equally &amp; kindly no matter their religion is the best way to fight against terrorism is crazy speak.  #qanda
it is sheer and utter insanity to go back into the shifting sands of the Middle East conflict.. Rethink now! #QandA
Australia may be an island but we don't exist in isolation from the rest of the world @qanda
Hm, I hardly think we went to war in Iraq in regards to equality. Quick! Alert Saudi Arabia and Brunei that we are declaring war! #qanda
@geraldmellor @maddydell @QandA that got on screen?
#qanda The Australian Liberal Party, continuing mistakes since 1916
If you destabilize a region you leave a vacuum for terrorism to take hod #qanda
while sinodinos says dont blame us for the middle east, who sells them the weapons and toyotas? #qanda
"Christian" refugees?? Are you joking? #qanda
#QandA Assess PPL on their merits - don't shove them back!
@QandA says Indonesia have delayed excecutions until after Constitution May 12 Court date , but no other media has picked up on this? #qanda
#QandA ISIS, a monster created by many western countries to fight a previous monster
Oh Arthur #qanda
you do realise that America funds and provides artillery to ISIS #qanda @qanda
The Australian media's obsession with ISIS is propagating their messages #QandA
#qanda many Syrian Christians support Bashar
Pls also remember that marriage equality isn't the be all and end all of equality for people of minority sexualities or gender. #qanda
I do like Arthur Sinodinous - there's a basic decency there #qanda

Herp a Derp stop the boats #qanda
Assess them on their merits, unless they come by boat #QandA
@newscomauHQ So what's she's doing is discriminating against those who don't have the same views on SSM.@tanya_plibersek @QandA
Where does the terror come from in our relatively (compared to others) safe country? Having a leader like Captain Death-Cult. #qanda
A simple question: What happens to the turned around refugees? @QandA #qanda
Women in Australia are being terrorised by men. But that's not important or something? #qanda
@tanya_plibersek Well said on #MarriageEquality on @QandA Other rights aren't' voted on, so why should this?
Arthur, what threat do indigenous rights and marriage equality pose to modern Australia? It's all human rights. #qanda
What a cracker of a show, solid panel too #qanda
Inclusiveness like Team Australia &amp; Human Rights like locking children indefinitely in detention #qanda
Only together can we stand against terror. Arm in arm; side by side with goodwill towards each other. #qanda
Dear Coalition of The Willing, You broke it, you fix it.  #qanda
@Brocklesnitch @maddydell @QandA yep
@QandA #QandA Deport all fundamentalists

#qanda the war on terror, the war on drugs, the war on refugees...all failures!

West created failed state for ISIS to thrive #QandA
#qanda Arthur's a charmer. Though must say he seems a little plumper! #plumpcats
#qanda it would be considered terrorism if a Muslim person performed these acts. It's still terrorism even if done under the act of war
They are human, religion shouldn't matter ... #qanda

#qanda Remind me again, did Jesus carry an uzi or a cross.. to love his enemies?
#Qanda "zero tolerance" sounds a bit authoritarian to me :) lol
I love @tanya_plibersek #qanda #MarriageEquality
Respect ANZAC memories by....stopping the boats. Especially the ones from Nepal. #qanda
Their policy is equality. All refugees are equally discriminated against. #QandA
@Brocklesnitch @geraldmellor @QandA I missed it but I think so?
Religion will not be missed in the distant future  #qanda
'Based on need' - Australian political needs #qanda
The problem with a conscience vote is the flawed assumption that MPs have one #qanda #marriageequality @QandA
QandA We care more about not upsetting Muslims than helping the helping of thousands of Christians
#QandA Zero tolerance indeed.
If you want to stop terrorism stop doing it! #qanda
@QandA War, what is it good for........absolutely nothing.
What the? We totally compromise the human rights of the refugees of the war on terror #qanda
a person is a person no matter what religion #QandA
The TPI Vietnam vet spoke of history censorship.  Arthur Sinodenos on #qanda soon after gives a superb performance illustrating the same.
#qanda Christians are not the only ones who matter, actually.
Arthur has practiced that answer. #qanda
@KermitMaree @seanjelinek @QandA no because more often than not it excludes important factors &amp; influences if the time
War and religion whoa! important topics needed more time. #qanda
Education in the middle east is needed as these kids who grow up with nothing with fight for "Anything". #qanda
Arthur Sinodinos, should there be a federal icac? #qanda @qanda

Zero tolerance on Islamic extremism. Absolutely! #qanda
Watch #4corners from tonight for real insight on this. #qanda
The greatest need is here. It's in Nauru and Manus Island. And look at what we're doing to them. #QandA
this #qanda made me feel like a branch about to break under the weight of the wrong opinions of the angry white men in charge of australia
We ask Indonesia for mercy but show little to refugees who try to get to our shores #qanda
After metadata retention it's a bit rich for a Coalition senator to talk about exchanging human rights for national security. #qanda
Migrations based on need, or ability to play cricket #qanda
#qanda humanitarian aid should be regardless of creed, culture or religion
Can one assess refugees on merit if one tows all the boats back? #qanda
"Humanitarian intake should be based on the greatest need" Yup. There's plenty of that. We have room #qanda #refugees
When I hid my surname on Facebook, public attacks on the ABC page from those presuming I have a Zionist bias disappeared with it. Sad #QandA

Great round of questions tonight. So which need is the greatest? #qanda
@DobZombie @RichardDawkins @QandA ha I love that idea.
#qanda The Commonwealth of Australia was born in the Exhibition Building in Melbourne in 1901, not on the beaches of any foreign country.
Tanya, when will you voice your own opinion and not sit on the fence? @QandA #QandA
#qanda our humanitarian intake should be quadrupled.
Bystanders affect outcomes of conflict - so act like a good bystander &amp; accept refugees! #QandA
Ironic that religion is the impetus for much of the world's worse human rights abuses #qanda
"When it comes to refugees I like to be non-discriminatory. I like to accept no one. " is what he means #qanda
U.S funded Al Qaeda and helped give rise to ISIS. Aus govt now persecutes those fleeing these countries in offshore detention. shame. #QandA
Show me a religion that is not by its very nature extremely fundamental Tim? Its all based on belief. Not facts. #qanda
#qanda does that go for christian extremism as well Tim?
Zero tolerance is fundamentalist #qanda
Religion should have absolutely no influence on refugee acceptance, what a ridiculous notion. #needsbased #refugees #qanda
Agree with Tim. Zero tolerance of religion, in general #QandA
OK. So no fundamentalist christians are getting in then Tim!? #qanda
Well said Tim F: "Zero tolerance to fundamentalists" #QandA @QandA
Sound reply from Sinodinos. We should have no truck with authoritarian regimes, but where would you start in the Middle East? #QandA
#qanda produced the goods tonight!

The values we are seeking to defend, says Arthur. Like greater surveillance of &amp; less protections for average citizens? #qanda

zero tolerance IS fundamentalism Tim! #QandA
Same with @newscomauHQ jutting into the #QandA Twitter stream. What's going on?
Tony Abbott blocking gay rights to marriage is a form fundamentalism #QandA
So Arthur wants to assess refugees on their merits. What about increasing the numbers because of the need? #qanda
If Tania Plibersek believes in the truism of equality we'll know as she resigns on principal if Labor conscience vote is not allowed #qanda

Good points!    #QandA https://t.co/xnce4SwkfK
#QandA basing it on need is proposterous, we all need something  and some of our 'needs' are not necessarily beneficial for us
Sinodinus...wasn't he the bloke at Howard's elbow at the beginning of this war on terror? #qanda
Why do politicians say one thing on Q&amp;A and another in parliament! #QandA
ISIS fighters are taught to run away from female fighters. SEND MORE WOMEN to the Middle East! #QandA #AusPol @QandA

What about the role of protecting people in the middle east #QandA
let's take more atheists #qanda
It's painfully ironic for the government to talk about protecting human rights when it trashes it in respect to refugees. #QandA

Did anyone tell George Brandis about that whole "not sacrificing our fundamental values thing?" I feel like me missed that memo #qanda

The Anzac narrative seriously requires a separative improvisation to stop commercializing the lives, legacies of fallen soldiers. #qanda
#qanda Politicians need to get out of self promotion generally in relation to militarism as well as personal tragedy. Opportunistic PR.
