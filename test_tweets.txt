I Betcha most of the suicides are all men. No one will talk about that little fact I bet... #QandA #AusPol
@QandA Dave would love a good beer
How about the Catholic priests abusing young children. Pretty sure that's against Australian law too. #qanda
To fix a problem you need to identify the cause. Continously blaming the Muslim religion means the answer will always be elusive #qanda
That project had a negative cost benefit analysis to the tune of 45 cents in the dollar #QandA
Fed govt can't claim to not cause sovereign risk. They have upset international investors by threatening to reduce the RET. #qanda
Andrew Robb is a true charisma vacuum. #qanda
We've got a worse alcohol epidemic than ice. Sharia law could fix that.  #QandA
Nobody else finds it sad that the best thing our pm has done is drink a beer?? #qanda
Mental health and jobs would stop people from dug and alcohol dependence #qanda
#qanda Andrew Robb is telling us about broken promises? - LOL!
Mutton head Dutton is behind this. #qanda
#qanda https://t.co/tp1rzQjjk3
Sydney and Melbourne don't need more roads. They need London-style rapid transit systems. Cleaner, cheaper, fast &amp; efficient. #qanda #auspol
Oh please. Photo set up totally #qanda
#qanda the people ain't going to get to town any faster on that silly expensive project. What was in it for LNP? Extortion
#qanda wow take cars off the road? What with car service industry jobs???? Hello what economic school did you go to!
I can't hear #qanda on my computer full volume - over the sound of the wind and lashing rain. Sydney being blasted tonight
What about RWNJ extremists like Alan Jones and Andrew Bolt? Shouldn't they be put into a de-radicalisation program? #qanda
Mama we're all crazee now... #qanda
Is the room hotboxed!?!?!? #qanda
The litmus test is only going to show up one result- most people's understanding of Islam and the Muslim community is basic #qanda
nah he's just straight to the dingaz these days right? #qanda
Politicians doing something crazy, who'd have thought. #qanda
6mins into the first 1/4 &amp; Derryn leads references to his own jail time 2-0. Let's see if he can keep up the scoreboard pressure. #QandA
Maybe if Victorians were consulted on EW llink instead of dictated to by Lib govt, Napthine might still have a job. #qanda
But moderate Muslims need to be more vocal about ISIS not representing them #QandA
Has @QandA sold out too?? @TonyJones_qanda has trade minister @AndrewRobbMP on and doesn't ask a single question about the #TPP ?? #qanda
Why isn't @jeff_kennett on tonight's panel on #QandA ?
@bush_bushy1961 Would love to see that shoved up the arse of Tony Jones! #qanda
@TonyAbbottMHR is impacting my mental health. #Qanda @QandA
Then design a new road just don't build something that isn't going to work #qanda
#qanda https://t.co/yMO2q4r9KO
Robb about to make a lifestyles choices gaffe #rules #qanda
Imagine if 7 soldiers died each day #qanda
Swimming, sneezing and laughing - great ways to get the endorphins going to beat the black dog says Andrew Robb, plus medication.  #qanda
#qanda don't expect any pilots to admit they have depression
@TonyAbbottMHR is a roads scholar after all #qanda @QandA #auspol
Or was he really thirsty? #QandA
I'm guessing the applause meter on the eastwest question/answer will reflect the vic election result  #QandA
#QandA Are we not all living in one Community.#qanda
people protesting on #qanda please stop and wait for your turn.  This show is as democratic as we are going to get. #ujcomm2657
It also got you into jail Derryn... #qanda
#qanda Can we have some roads without potholes please?
@QandA C'mon Derryn, say it. "Shame, Australia, shame!" #qanda
Anna Burke speaks such sense! Less cars more rail! #QandA
Terrorism has killed just over 100 Australians in the past 30 years. Suicide kills 6 a day. Let's worry about the big problems. #qanda
Aussie frameworks @Mind__Matters @KidsMatterAus help decrease stigma &amp; promote #mentalhealthau @healthgovau #qanda
De-radicalise Murdoch media #qanda @QandA
Best video question since Julian Assange. Great work Ethan #qanda
Hang on, wasnt @stephenkamos  going to be on #QandA tonight???
Andrew Robb #genius #QandA
Building roads was one of only only five commitments of Govt and Robb says they are not obsessed with roads? #QandA
Most public transport options in outer Sydney involve travel times double a car, even with the notorious congestion. End of debate #qanda
Unfortunately the government can't use Mental health issues to push it's agenda #qanda
Andrew Robb is just a nice guy! #qanda
@QandA about time now to review the Sunk Cost Fallacy. #qanda
@QandA I bet tony jones likes a bit of chardy he wouldn't be a beer man.
#qanda - Spend the cash on public transport infrastructure that will free up the roads AND make PT run more efficiently. Then EVERYONE wins
#qanda thank God that fright ain't going to happen!
@QandA talk about 'road rage'. Weren't we just talking about saving people's lives? #QandA
Hinch is kiwi-born so he can sleep easy #qanda
Unfortunately the stigma is still there because many are misinformed about this debilitating illness. #QandA
We are all responsible for addressing suicide - it affects us all and it is something no-one wants to talk about until it's too late #qanda
Are the young Libs radicalised? #qanda
Yeah wow, Hughes has zero idea what he's saying. #qanda
How about we ask White Australians if they reject racism instead? #qanda
That first qanda question was absolutely disgusting.
How does Andrew Robb feel when he's forced to vote along party lines for cuts to #mentalhealth #qanda
#qanda Not admitting people with Autism is not a new issue.
Remember, it wasn't Labor that signed the clause for $500m on that contract. It was the Libs.  #qanda
#QandA partnership without politics on mental health. Is it possible?
Use Public Transport with ease when overseas, never do at home, unreliable, poor access. Europe can do it, why can't we? #qanda
#qanda @QandA islamophobia on social media are due to terrorism propagated by muslims.
Ice epidemic is bad, but minimal in comparison to the effects of alcohol abuse in Aust #qanda
Sounds like we need another discussion, consultation and white paper. Guaranteed ZERO progress. #QandA
#qanda did he give in to peer pressure? Maybe he wanted a beer?
Lies from Robb, no one wants to go to Geelong. #QandA
So much for having a question about the TPP #qanda
Didn't Hughes just contradict the whole point of the drinking thing by calling Hinch a wanker for drinking not to get drunk? #QandA
His head is entirely flat. Like an envelope RT @TerryAustralis: #qanda http://t.co/BrghrcUoKC
Unless you're an Indigenous Australian, Australia is not really yours to reclaim... #ujcomm2657 #QandA @QandA
The assumption that all Muslims are extremists and support a caliphate is deeply offensive. #qanda
The fact that Abbott is using terrorism for political gain is not helping the community hate towards Muslims #QandA
Not so much the Human Headline as the Human Hairdye. #QandA
Tolerance means we put up with it. What an indictment of smug, self important horseshit to congratulate ourselves for our tolerance. #qanda
Ice is really bad. But alcohol still trumps it in the damage to people stakes. #qanda
I'm not sure that government-funded deprogramming is the solution #qanda
Audience members screaming out for #TPP questions, #qanda host Tony Jones says "we will get to it" but then...? He never does. Disgraceful.
#qanda what about mental illness of refugees?
This lady's hand gestures are very irritating #qanda
Christ, Robb would be hard pressed to get an easier Dixer even if the Whips' office had a hand in it #qanda
The answer is public schooling! #qanda
Thank you Anna Burke, we were double dudded by abbott.  #qanda
It doesn't sound horrifying, it is horrifying!  #qanda
There are many mental health professionals unable to provide MH  services due to being excluded from Medicare system. @qanda #qanda
Tony won't stand for people interrupting his chance to interrupt... #qanda
#qanda driving the stream crazy again. lol.
@beneltham @QANDA #qanda no moshing allowed!
#qanda It's a very local question
What was that person yelling about?? #qanda
#qanda THIS is why I don't watch QandA...
#QandA Darryn is right, there is stigma
so good job dickhead #qanda
This and previous Govts seem to value mental health services about the same as dental health services. Both terribly underfunded #qanda
I demand #theirABC and #QandA apologise now http://t.co/MVE4kwXBcu
Hard to depend on families when 1 in 4 women is a victim of domestic violence #qanda
 #qanda
'Warnie' is absolutely outdated and, let's be honest, a teeny bit creepy #qanda
It wasn't Andrews that did damage, it was Napthine's govt signing contracts &amp; sabotaging Vic &amp;  ALP govt  #qanda
I sneeze looking at the sun too but it doesn't make me happy it just makes me sneeze #qanda
Most Uni students these days are binge drinking themselves into depression and anxiety #qanda
The alcohol industry relies on sport in Australia #QandA
Nothing like hearing a personal experience  #QandA
Ughhh I'm about to break my qanda ban for the first time in years but your tweets are very discouraging.
All those people will be zombies- good point Derryn. #qanda
#qanda Love Dave Hughes too.
Schools are best examples of where cultural diversity works #qanda
.@HumanHeadline mentions Horsham on #qanda while talking about ice epidemic. "They ran out of syringes"
@DHughesy The most authentic, useful &amp; inspiring thing I have ever heard you say! @QandA #GoodMums
Andrew Robb just earned my respect #QandA
The east west link would give trucks a 2nd option around Melbourne other than city link. #QandA
East west wouldn't have solved the geelong issue.... #qanda
Tones tried to pull a Hawkey  #epicfail #qanda
#qanda why aren't we talking TPP It's the biggest issue we face
@carmelmccallum #qanda
I'm with the kid. This is just wrong!  #qanda
Roads are good for mental health #QandA
hahahahaha Honored position? Abbott has sullied the office Robby #qanda
#qanda crickey its a strange day when derryn makes sence
#qanda We drink heavily, get over it? I don't think so
#qanda What about the whitefella former Labor leader in the NT? He's gone to fight in the M-E and returned scot free!
Finally someone's asked that question for the billionth time  #qanda
Anna Burke. There was a speaker, unlike Bronwyn Bishop #auspol #QandA
Take $30 billion subsidies to religion, the other type of mental illness #QandA
Great frank discussion on #mentalhealth on #qanda
By 2020 it is predicted that depression will be the second highest cause of death #qanda
We are Andrew Robb's bosses and he told us all #qanda
Thank you #qanda for speaking about depression. Now have the guts to link it with alcohol.
GoAnna #ewlink #qanda
There is a structural relationship: economic inequality causes radical right wing politics - UKIP &amp; Ome Nation are the same #qanda
And that is not even counting the refugees and asylum seekers we unlawfully detain! #QandA
It is sadly ironic, the sector as fragmented as a lot of the people within it feel #Qanda
You might, doesn't me mean we do.. @Avantiiii #qanda
A game of ice one-upmanship on #QandA tonight
Teenagers have the highest suicide and mental health rates. We need to focus on those who are raising the next generation. #qanda
Fantastic to see depression being discussed on #QandA. Sad though that the stigma is still there.
#qanda I didn't want the road.
I now refuse to watch #qanda after they continually put a communist on the panel as if her point really matters. Shame on abc
Islam and its Muslim supporters don't want integration they call us infidels #qanda
We need to scrap bail #qanda
#qanda good mental health for all is essential  for #carers, in the workplace, in the community...
Finally a question about #NMHCReport - we can act on recommendations now says @janeburns #qanda
#qanda here we go!!!
Tis the unions fault ... #qanda
Police arrest 5 men for plotting terror attacks and the #qanda panel "hope the raids don't make things worse"! You're kidding, right?!
Black dog strategies. Fascinating. Admirable honesty. #qanda
A panel stacked with left-wingers.... Business as usual for #TheirABC again. #qanda
Nearly 60min gone by, still not single question or comment regarding #TPP, is everyone oblivious? or has #QandA been gagged by LNP?
Look after the whole Carlton team, they may be suffering depression #qanda
People. When the Australian fleet first arrived, they drank. The closest we had to a revolution was the Rum Rebellion #qanda
Go on, #qanda. Put up the tweet about how racism and bigotry incites suicide. Remind the people how evil Reclaim Australia is. #qanda
#RealAustraliansSayWelcome - an important notion to remember, we must celebrate our differences. #qanda
#qanda promoting parody accounts @RitaPanahi http://t.co/q3b08ZZIgN

@QandA Struggling with @AndrewRobbMP 
Know the triggers of your depression. Analyse the cause &amp; effect, learn to be aware of your thoughts processes. Say no to pills! #qanda
Jeezus, Tony Abbott drinking questions: why I'm happy to no longer live in Australia anymore #qanda
Tony Abbot's beer skol debate on #qanda proves that we are getting to understand the bigger picture of alcohol problems.
Dave, you are not special; why are you there and not me #thanksDave #QandA
@BrendanFrankly You exhibit neither compassion nor intelligence. As you were. #QandA
Who cares #qanda
#qanda http://t.co/Q6nqc9ltxe
Bullshit Andrew Robb #qanda
@QandA It's easy to crack a sickie. How hard would it be to go to work and pretend to be well all day everyday #quanda
Springvale represent! Oh wait... #qanda
was Andrew Robb's 'it happens' an abbreviation of 'shit happens?' #qanda
Okay... #TPP now? #qanda
#qanda Glad he is coping with the depression.But still a first class twat who lacks empathy.
This case seems ridiculous. Will the Minister intervene? #QandA #auspol
I love @DHughesy! Calls a spade a spade..No BS..Just says what everyday Aussies are thinking! #QandA
Just walked into the room. Saw Hinch then Robb. Walked straight out again. #qanda
Stop putting asylum seekers up in hotels for months and dedicate the money to mental health #tonystoppedtheboats #labordidnot #qanda
Legislate mental health leave. #qanda
@QandA please shut Joan up
Stupid man in the audience - the LNP govt signed a side letter locking us into the contract TWO weeks before the election #qanda
Reallocation of funding to help people in need to flourish within their communities #NMHCReport #mentalhealth #qanda @janeburns

Socks, trackies and #qanda http://t.co/5imD8S5xJ7
PUBLIC SPEAKER. #QANDA
#QandA Is anyone seriously suggesting young people take their cultural queues from Tony Abbott?
#qanda What a liar Robb is espousing LNP propaganda.
@MsHumoresque Hail healer. Did you watch the QandA episode? They were talking about psychology, drugs and depression
Whether you love him or loathe him, @HumanHeadline is never afraid of calling a spade a spade! #qanda
Victoriana voted against the road. Doesnt Andrews have a mandate? #qanda
Dino Dibra #qanda
The good thing about alternative groups is that if one doesn't work for you, you can try the next. #QandA
Everyone should be watching #QandA just for @janeburns.
Public transport expansion is such a no brainer #QandA
Good thing Double Bay falls outside the lockout zone. That makes binge drinking there acceptable #qanda
Time to start looking at ice addiction as a health issue and not a political football #qanda
An extraordinary voice for the #mentalhealth community in @janeburns #QandA
Are we meant to think the PM skolling a beer makes him "one of the boys"? It just reinforces our need to drink to have fun. #qanda
#qanda our leaders need to set the agenda for a harmonious society, calling asylum seekers " illegal immigrants " doesn't help
Australia has a growing problem with the idea that alcohol is a reward. #qanda
Oh no we all have the same dna but what about all those crime labs Dave? #qanda
Andrew Robb is basically just naming random countries now #qanda
Round of applause @janeburns - now rest up and relax! #qanda
I wonder if the NBN-supporters care about the cost-benefit analysis for EW Link #qanda
Well done Hughesy. The most compassionate answer to this ridiculously divisive issue. #qanda
This is so depressing! #qanda
Derryn Hinch can't let a woman speak for more than 30 seconds. #qanda
#Qanda I'd like to see Abbott smoke a joint on stage #qanda #420blazeit
Camus wrote a fantastic book on the absurd question of suicide. The Myth of Sisyphus is an uplifting read for anyone. #qanda
Now, why don't we spend the next 20 minutes of a national TV show talking about a unbuilt road in Melbourne? #qanda
Sadly, this week's #qanda has become an episide of "what about the poor white people?" #qanda
High Fives Ethan #qanda
#QandA Anna take it on the chin this is labor's suicide they waste money and blame Libs
Locking people up for 14 days without laying charges is a great way to diffuse extremism... Oh wait... #qanda
Stigma? Oz govt is creating mental illness in refugees, &amp; then intends stigmatising them to refuse acceptance. #qanda
Litmus test? Seriously, an oral/written test does not do anything other than ostracise #qanda
#qanda #LegalizeTed #Skimlinks #Overstock #Amazon !
Victorian #qanda - you call that a protest! Remember the banner-unfurling student protest in Sydney that caused a broadcast shutdown
Dave Hughes sounds like he got lost and ended up on the #qanda panel.
I think Andrew Robb wanted to segue to ANZAC day when he dropped the irrelevant "what about those Turks". Didn't work #qanda
The person who has done most damage to our reputation surely is Tony Abbot #QandA
young people are lured to extremism due to lack of meaning &amp; community in their current lives. #qanda
Many who are depressed don't even know they are #qanda
"Vegan extremists"?! What about meat eaters, Anna Burke? #qanda
@QandA Maybe Tony Abbott was just washing down another onion #qanda
I would pay higher taxes to pay for better mental health services  #qanda
Ask @TonyAbbottMHR about drinking ;) @QandA #QandA
It can take 15 years for people to get the right help. This has to shift. #NMHCReport #qanda
A litmus test is fine provided every Australian has to take it. #QandA
Tony Abbott takes great pride in turning back boats. Those people are raped and killed as a consequence. #qanda
Hughesy doesn't drink and Tony Abbott is a dangerous drug ! #QandA #quanda
#qanda Surprised to find myself agreeing with Derryn Hinch for a change.
#qanda https://t.co/S1pbA8yCer
I'm waiting for someone to throw a shoe. #qanda
That's called investing in Australia!! #qanda
Imagine if we saw subsequent footage of Abbott scoffing a kebab. Then he'd be encourage obesity too. #qanda
The beer in the pub played well with focus groups so Abbott did it. #qanda
A litmus test will only tell you how acidic they are. #QandA
Fantastic, more people to tell us how we should live. #qanda
The Govt needs to allocate funding to mental health services today #QandA
'sovereign risk' haven't heard that for a while #qanda
we're going to spend 10 minutes talking about the goddamn beer. #qanda *keeps hate watching*
How about a litmus test on Australian racism? #QandA
Andrew Robb, proving tonight that the government simply is not doing enough to promote social cohesion. #qanda
Excessive drinking kills women #qanda
It's unexplainable isn't it Andrew? #QandA
I wouldn't feel comfortable calling Tony Abbott Prime Minister for the rest of my life... #qanda
What would we of said if Tony was a woman? #qanda
So there is a Whyalla wipeout after all? #qanda
People are mistrusting of big pharma, to their detriment. TAKE THE MEDS! #qanda
Hinch, I saw you so pissed as a fart at Lotus in South Yarra in 2003, you could hardly stand up. Don't lecture PM on drinking beer. @qanda
Bomber Thompson on #OpenMike &gt; #QandA
It is your God given right to be a radical for whatever you desire.  As Long as it doesn't endanger other people's lives #qanda
yeah let's just drum up that cultural used xenophobia, completely warranted #qanda

This is what happens when you try to have rational dialogue with Islam #qanda http://t.co/9ORYqTDkrD
@qanda Go Jane!!!!!
Outstanding question Ethan!!! #qanda come on panel, keep it real, ANSWER Ethan's question.
#Qanda FSS Tony Jones shut up.
@qanda #qanda I need help and honestly have no confidence that it can be continuous. So I ask why should I?
#qanda Have you tried to access mental health services quickly? still very under resourced and expensive to access therapy @QandA
Nonsense. All forms of transept are needed. Efficient PT makes a huge difference to reasonable road travel. #qanda  https://t.co/wfGykXRaf9
We've heard from the experts. Use the report , take advantage of it and start paving the way to some real solutions !! #qanda
Where'd the twitter feed? #qanda
Mental illness is an illness, not a lifestyle choice. Let's keep mental health on Australia's radar and help those suffering @QandA #QandA
All Robb is doing is trying to explain why his government is doing nothing for mental health.  #QandA
'Knocking out' extremism, sounds extreme #qanda
Hinch doesn't support light rail as you can't terrorise his audience with it.  #qanda
And here's the ALP rep bagging Australians. #qanda
And yet how often does an Australian woman die at the hands of her partner? Oh yeah we only discuss that on domestic violence week #qanda
@MWhalan In 12m time will metadata requests (numbers/type) be on public record so we can see what % just supports DMCA requests? #qanda
C'mon on Derryn, a case before the courts has never been an impediment to you voicing an opinion in the past. :) #qanda
More pigheaded ideology from the Liberal government #QandA
#qanda more needs to be done for middle class , ones not on benefits or that can not afford counseling.
@jarednash5  good to see you back in qanda action tonight!
@QandA really needs more air time or stick to a topic alcohol/ice/suicide/mental health/immigration/autism/roads all in one hour?
#QandA  Evidenced based policy making is not a strength of the LNP
Here's a gimme #QandA
Sobriety is not the only option. Medication can help people with a problem to drink moderately. #QandA
Drug addicts let themselves down. #qanda
#qanda what a load if nonsense public transport does not help tradesman and delivery drivers the tunnel is needed.
#qanda What the difference between drinking a schooner quickly or playing a pair of chopsticks quickly? nothing. Competitive males.
#qanda what's with the fireworks noises? #soundslikepennybungers
Obviously light rails are very very popular @qanda #qanda
May not agree with his policies but respect to the man #qanda
Alcohol causes more problems in Australia than Ice ever has #qanda
What a wonderful answer from @AndrewRobbMP @QandA congratulations. A fantastic example
@QandA way more needs to be highlighted about depression and suicide good to see some discussion lets see ACTION now right now
#QandA  There is almost nothing anyway for children with disabilities parents carry the burden
This government will conduct as many studies as it takes to find one that agrees with them. #QandA
My sister wants us to wear matching dresses to my other sister's wedding. Is it kosher? #qanda #justasking #yololo
Tonight's tweets have taught me how to properly spell 'skoll'. #QandA
Anyone remember Tony's St. Patrick's Day video? How many beers did he want? P.S. Joe Hockey had switched to S Club Seven.. #qanda
The big problem is violence related to alcohol! #qanda
@HSM_AUS #qanda
Oh really? Andrew Robb likes art? How about using the budget to properly fund the arts then, yeah? #qanda
Hughesy needs to roast everyone on the panel #qanda
"Ice is destroying a generation." #QandA #suicide #gethelp #Depression #mentalhealth #mentalillness #qanda #iceepidemic
@NassimKhadem @QandA Even a light rail or dedicated long-bus only lane
Instead of watching #qanda tonight I will instead turn my TV off and not watch #qanda. #overandout
We shouldn't use the word "committed" in front of suicide - it implies something criminal. They suicided or died by suicide. #qanda
People booing someone asking a question about the TPP? Good doggies! #qanda
#qanda when can we see the text of TPP?question ft Minister Robb
Wasted 500 mil. Would have wasted way more if it had been built! Lesser of 2 evils! #qanda
@QandA our roads need to be fixed and we need to stop pointing the finger and start working together otherwise it will just get worse.
Wow, straight to the bigot #qanda
See why watch #qanda when there's all this solid gold man advice right here at Shannonimity Ltd.?
#qanda this is a very naive and shallow conversation on Islam, religion, ideology, secularism, privacy issues, police powers. rhetorical
I feel another Cronulla riots around the corner... #QandA #AusPol
How do you know you have it if you've always had it? #QandA
Andrew, was the signing of this contract 2 weeks before the election not a 'political exercise'? #qanda
The overlap between grog, aggression, perceived masculinity &amp; male behaviour is causing untold damage. #qanda
#qanda Ethan! Well done!
@QandA maybe we should stop moralising about alcohol, relax and enjoy a drink!
It's getting hectic in the #qanda audience tonight!
Too many Australian men are drinking to cope with shame &amp; pressure. It's a wildly unhealthy problem. #QandA
First question from the White Supremacist please #qanda
Extremists are a minority and we should be celebrating the majority who embrace multiculturalism #QandA
War on terror led to strong response and radical legislation. Mental health report leads to more govt talk #qanda
John Howards dog whistling wedge politics is now showing its results with prejudice &amp;radicalisation stemming from Islamaphobia @QandA #QandA
PM Abbott is still PM and he is already a has been. A hopeless PM who has achieved nothing. #qanda
Has Dave Hughes been booked for the wrong night? #qanda
If we built the road it would keep costing us for years. Great decision to not build it. #QandA
A Few Good Men starting now on One - #QandA had better be good or I'll be issuing it with a "code red"...
The first questioner has been an angry young questioner on #qanda before.
Can we get a petition for this? #QandA
@RitaPanahi @QandA @anguslivingston .Will probably confuse the 50 people who watch the pretentious crap. Me, I'm watching the test pattern.
#QandA @QandA Why stop at religions for the litmus test. Include politicians and journalists in it too
Where is the discussion on this domestic terrorism? #qanda
Is there anything HInch doesn't know or hasn't experienced? #QandA
Boooo... get out! #qanda
you don't get a choice where your tac us spend. that is how it works. grow up. #qanda
@DanielleArmstr1 The limited number of funded visits to psychologists under Medicare is inadequate for people needing long term help #qanda
@registradus WTF is he doing?! #qanda
A litmus test is too basic. &lt;&lt; see what I did there? #qanda
Thats not a question! Thats racism! #qanda
Dans our man. #qanda
#qanda does your on-air twitter feed accept new multiracial emojis? I've poignant tweet about Reclaim Oz but need black guy in turban emoji.
@QandA just so it
MARTIN PLACE - it was there before Melbourne was, Minister.  #QandA
Lulz what fantasy Robb, get your finance buddies, fond of stealing from clients to prove it #qanda
Obama knows how to keep it classy. #qanda
Hats off @DHughesy for recognising a problem and stopping it in its tracks! #qanda
Melb public transport is a joke. Roads on the other hand are bottleneck tragedies. #qanda
#qanda Overstatement by Robb hardly helpful.
#qanda Yeah but its NOT actually all about economics, @AndrewRobbMP .U need to get that.
#QandA seems as if suicide is getting more common.
@InsideCricketEd @LinnyHaze @QandA like those crazy guys @propagandhi , crazy vegan supremacists (joking, Chris)
They dont say they want the road - they want the problem solved #QandA @QandA
If only Robb was this open about the TPP... #qanda
Learnt a new word tonight 'Litmus' thanks #qanda
I'm not ready to discuss the Prime Minister drinking beer, I'm still trying to process him biting a raw onion. #qanda
Made the mistake of glancing at #qanda. Worse choice of panel for topic EVER. Goodnight.
Fragmentation is happening because staff are stretched monitoring existing programs without being able to take on new projects #qanda
Depression is an illness like any other- stop treating it differently, stigmatising makes it harder to climb out... #beenThere #qanda
Take Robb's origami away from him #QandA
#QandA  I reckon being in prison as a child is pretty frightening, Andrew Robb.  Get Kids out!
yeah #qanda just put the fake rita panahi account on screen...
Why in Aust 7 ppl a day suicide? And the majority are youth. Mental health issues but WHY? How do we compare with other countries? #qanda

Let's talk about the relationship between alcohol and depression #qanda
@foster_ro @fedupofpollys @QandA @CARoyalComm The media reports on whatever sells their product. Child abuse seems 2 have gone off the radar
#qanda The department.....its the Gov of secrets, lies &amp; operational matters. Dont blame your flunkies.
Yep we get it Hinch was incarcerated. You can grow up now #qanda
Warney has been placed in charge of audience conduct on #QandA tonight.
#qanda Tony channeled yet another former PM. Who next? Billy McMahon? Harold Holt?
Just my personal thoughts but I'm impressed with @AndrewRobbMP #qanda decent man who has achieve some great FTAs @dfat
Acceptance of...diversity. Right. Like Hizb Ut-Tahrir. How about no? #qanda
To interact as a community we need to come face to face. Humanity and kindness are far more forthcoming this way than online #qanda
This panel is so passive aggressive #qanda
Australia used to be better than this. #qanda
Fuck off @AndrewRobbMP. Oh my god. #QandA
Things can and do get better. Andrew Robb is proof. #qanda
Cultures everywhere around the world drink to celebrate achievements. It's only Aussies that people afterwards. #qanda
Hinch says he's not going back to gaol this year. Can I start a book on that? #qanda
If those are the rules they need to be changed  #QandA
Where's the applause #qanda ?
Refusing to collect revenue which also reduces #climatechange is the real sovereign risk. #QandA #auspol
Didn't know autism was a communicable disease. #QandA
Never found an employer who is able to deal with mental illness and the unpredictability  #qanda

Big ups to @DHughesy shutting down Derryn Hinch on @QandA
People cheering for light rail? This would never happen in Canberra. #qanda
It is terrible. #qanda
Awesome parenting to listen to your son and seek professional help #qanda
social media is always watching, especially when you're the prime minister #qanda
#qanda they aren't on bail if they were released with no charges. Occur to you that maybe they were released because there was no evidence?
The stigma surrounding men's mental health is a serious issue that must be addressed. #qanda
Tony Abbott has caused my Depression. Can we boot him out of office? That would go a long way to improving my life. #qanda
We must stop calling depression a mental illness that would be a good start #Qanda
Tony Abbott's political career is littered with misguided photo opportunities #qanda
More funding is needed #qanda
Our legal system can always be improved but the fact remains that social cohesion needs to be developed from the grassroots level #QandA
Can we please get more people shouting random crap from the audience? #qanda
Anna Bourke...you rock #qanda
@Qanda have given up trying to watch live feed. Hopeless
#qanda How come a consortium can have the power to gain such amount while not building the road?  Is there a law/clause to stop that!?
Mental illness and being an excellent contributor to society, are not mutually exclusive and should never be seen that way. #QandA
@QandA lock up the ice and heroin addicts until they dry out--and stop mollycoddling them
#qanda #allthestupids
Best #qanda in a long time! We need more talk about mental illness!
Media reports around the "terrorists" in the last few days has been poor at best! #QandA #AusPol
Vegans and Terrorists compared together...am I the only one who is sitting here very confused... #QandA
Q for Tim Fischer next week. Why did you clandestinely support McGowan in 2013 federal election? @QandA #qanda
Learning a second language is a start to understand different cultures and discourage extremism #qanda
Depression ought not stop anyone from success #qanda
Anna should know how to deal with a Dixer like that. #qanda
This current govt makes me wanna #TopMyself - seriously! #Qanda Which is scientifically proven fact under #Conservative govts! @QandA
@RitaPanahi @QandA they just published a fake apology
The conversation needs to continue about mental health #qanda
Yes national security is about saving lives from the threat of mental illness not terrorism #qanda
@QandA Defence Veterans often fall victim to #PTSD as well as #depression and die as veterans not as combatants
#qanda Fantastic Andrew you were the last person I thought would suffer depression and talk about it.
Ahh, her name's Anna Burke. How did Victorians elect someone whose name is half their vocabulary? #qanda
Tony Abbott smashed a beer because he knew that he'd get praise for being a 'tough bloke'. Can we unpack that please? #QandA
#QandA   Australia's reputation is way down the drain because of an immoral federal government
Mental health - a crisis-driven system in crisis. Stop stalling, Better Access now! @QandA #QandA
The government haven't worked out how to make money off the mentally ill yet. They won't do anything until they do! @QandA #QandA
The Melbourne Recital Centre, or as @MickPuck dubbed it, Flintstonian Hall. #QandA
Depression is hard but you can learn to live with it #QandA
Well said Ethan. We should be able to support every child who comes to this country. From the mouth of babes; the truth. #qanda
Hawke, a man of the people. Abbott, a man of the elitists. #QandA
We are taught well enough at school so that no one is an islamophobist - we are welcoming of everyone #QandA @QandA
@QandA here's to "getting cars off the road" - we need to do this, people, it's the only option
For those looking for answers to Tony's policies, watch the video again. #qanda
We need to challenge the current rules around reporting suicide so that people become aware of how often and how close suicide is #qanda
tyrone should be allowed to go to school ! #qanda @QandA
The hardest thing about being depressed is telling people and having them not believe you - eradicate the stigma #qanda
There's a misunderstanding of 'jihad'; it means struggle, is intrinsic to Islam, can be done peacefully &amp; has been for centuries. #qanda
Wonderful sense from a young Australian - #Ethan's question on #QandA
The @beyondblue story just proves how well teamwork can work in politics #qanda
@pauldutton1968 just Andrew Robb negotiating the #TPP's dependence on antidepressants for public life. Hmm #judgementfail #qanda @QandA
Advisory groups and elaborate reports are the government's way of avoiding actual action. #qanda
@akaWACA Cree at the #QandA demanded from @AndrewRobbMP to simply explain how and why the TPP has only been access by multinationals
The congestion is from either direction to the city only. Not many travel from the east to the west daily. #qanda
This is some great insight from Andrew Robb I had no idea about his story #qanda
Hughesy: I think the toughest man in the pub is surrounded by a group of drinkers and says "No, I'll be right" #qanda
#QandA  Mental illness probably underlies many of our worlds problems-children growing up in war and trauma
Surprise surprise the 'upcoming question' on the TPP didn't make it. #qanda
What a beautiful venue for tonight's #qanda
Enough of the 'me too' stories #qanda
#QandA I believe in your. You believe in me. No judgement.
@RitaPanahi @QandA you rejected? Why? Please speak for all of us. I'm a nobody or I'd go and sort out those leftist muppets.
Time for a positive Captains Pick #qanda

"Vegan extremists." PEAK Q&amp;A. #qanda

"Those" "those places" "those young people". ? No wonder some young people feel like it's a case of us and them. #QandA
#qanda Australia's public transport infrastructure is poor No Vision or commitment by any govt
Yes, drinking is a problem - 4 some. But the more we separate youth from it the less ability they will have 2 deal with it properly  #qanda
anna burke ur the only one I &lt;3 #qanda
@Andrew_Bullen @QandA @RitaPanahi they're a bitter bunch at the ABC.
Skulling!! Not skolling!! We are not in Scandinavia !! #qanda
#QandA East-West link cost analysis showed 20 cent loss for every dollar spent
@QandA stigma will always exist, it is resilience along with people like Andrew to keep talking that we need
Great question from #qanda audience member. Honest and interesting answer from Andrew Robb.
Except they already did a poll hinchy - at election  #qanda
I took the litmus test - I'm acidic #qanda

That child has more compassion than people 4 times his age #qanda
Anna Burke is right, the key is acceptance not tolerance #QandA #UJCOMM2657
Lets deport children that upset politicians... seriously, we voted for this. #qanda
Is the government listening? #qanda
@QandA @janeburns @HumanHeadline it's a societal problem.  We ALL need to help not just the government.
Move to tassie #qanda @QandA

If the kid could scull a beer he would be allowed to stay. #qanda
Warner was probably paid for they comments. #qanda
Being open about mental illness ensues further acceptance #qanda
I can't hear you all moaning while my head fills up with wine and drowns the sound to a gurgle. #qanda

The 'infrastructure PM' - where is the spending?? This country needs more than words #qanda
#qanda will the East West Link have a sculpture to rival Jeff's Erection?
#QandA @QandA Stuff reallocation, increase overall funding. People's health is more important than a surplus or lower taxes
Muslims don't take responsibility for radicalisation, instead play the victim. Very few Muslims speak out &amp; condemn jihad #qanda
#QandA the is no crime in having a beer
Depressed teens Why is online bullying still causing suicide in teenagers, these bullies need to be questioned and charged by police #QandA
Melbourne's infrastructure is rubbish already. Build the Doncaster rail instead!! #qanda
@QandA Young Ethan - a great young voice standing up to be heard #QandA #disability #AutismAwareness #autism
"...we've boundless plains to share'. And money. For healthcare. Don't deport him #qanda
The Government is actively encouraging Islamaphobia.  #qanda
@noplain @beneltham Every genre of #qanda is the worst. It's the worst show on television &amp; should be cancelled immediately.
Working for Abbott would make anyone depressed. #qanda
We've far too few mental health support services, particularly for sub-acute, chronic and post-acute needs #QandA
This one's been on http://t.co/hMM2FRvOmM for months. The local MP has done nothing becuase Mum can't vote. #qanda
#QandA - if the minister almost always overrules in favour of staying why not change the basic rules?
White middle class heterosexual man: "we are all the same! Just chill out!" #qanda
Invisible disability is truly invisible. #qanda
The sign of a true and equal society is when the well off ride the rails to work with everyone else #qanda
Note to self: look at sun when sad. @QandA #qanda
You CAN NOT arrest and hold people without charge! WRONG! #qanda
@MarkGilbert15 @QandA Asians are are race... Muslims are not, stick to the facts, there are Muslim Asians mate!
Do me an analysis of how many people are travelling East-West or vice versa every day? It won't fix the issues. #QandA
Good on you @AndrewRobbMP for being so open and transparent. Mental health and depression thrives in secrecy.  @qanda #qanda #mentalhealth
When I told my boss I had depression, I got the flick for being sick. No bothered to help me. http://t.co/ujJQwFqKP9 #qanda @humanheadline
Go Anna Burke! #qanda
If the community is at an unprecedented level of fear, I don't think the panel is helping #stokingthefire #qanda
Maybe if our society was once more something bigger than consumers, profit and economic units, you wouldn't have people radicalising #qanda
I'm sorry Andrew it needs a quick decision. People are dying here! #qanda
Finally a #qanda episode I'm enjoying
I battled depression. I was in such a dark place that I considered suicide. I'm now doing much better today. Please, ask for help. #qanda
Totally agree with Anna Burke on hating the word 'tolerant'. Reminds me of @MariamVeiszadeh's comment: you tolerate a bad smell #QandA
Workplaces don't cope with pregnant women.  They won't deal well with someone suffering depression #QandA
Regardless of your position on EW link, never sign a $10 billion contract in the lead up to an election #QandA
David Hughes I thinkbI love you #qanda
Yes Jane!!! #QandA
Seven suicides a day in Australia is just tragic &amp; senseless. Just as senseless is the inaction in tackling this #QandA #auspol
Depression has a major detrimental effect on Trade Mr Robb. Your Ministry is involved  #QandA
Ethan understands #disability shouldn't be grounds for discrimination #qanda
Australian Muslim leaders have been speaking out against extremism. To say they haven't is a blatant lie. http://t.co/055kQ2TwVA #qanda
Andrew Rob cites the Turkish community as a prime example of a race who assimilated and embraced Australian life. It can be done #QandA
@RitaPanahi @QandA http://t.co/G1e3Wc3zFV
Australia has a *bad* problem with privilege. Everyone else bar the white middle-to-upper class people have a terrible life here. #qanda
Abbott have a drink is main discussion point, seems #QandA have lost the plot. Australia have 1000's of more important issue than this ?
Abbott called the Vic state election a referendum on east west link- and Daniel Won #qanda
The statistics for attempted suicides are mind blowing #qanda
Diversity. The secret to any species' survival #qanda
How many have you got? #qanda  https://t.co/cYKgqY9WUl
Activist disruption of #QandA was about the #ReleasetheTPP and #WhySoSecret this deal is NAFTA on steroids
Leadership is too abstract; how about addressing the causes of disenchantment. Economic factors such as unemployment matter #qanda
I like to think Islamophobic tendencies are of the minority in Australia. I really hope so. #qanda
StandupforEthan #qanda
something other than IS, thank god. #qanda
Does the entire Christian and Catholic sects take responsibility for the acts of an extreme minority? Why should Muslims? #qanda
Whatever you think of Derryn Hinch; he has courage to say what he thinks #qanda
Mr Robb, you are NOT helping the climate of fear with this divisive narrative. #qanda
#qanda did Abbott inhale ??
They act in 2 seconds to ship migrants to naru but wont act to save australian lives! #qanda
MH 13% national disease burden, funding less than 5% nationally. Can we talk about the level of MH funding @QandA #qanda #Healthbudget
We're talking about hysteria tonight #QandA
Is Tony going to cut to an old musical number? Or was that just for Sydney students? #qanda
@QandA   Depression is usally part of 1 or many problems and realising this is the first step to recovery.
@mattwardpix It's a great question to nurture a racial war. #qanda
The people of Victoria overwhelmingly voted for trains not roads. #qanda
#qanda The issues is short term rubbish promises from Politicians. All promise no completion.
Heart disease a bigger problem for Australia than alcohol. Yet no stigma over skolling soda. #QandA
Bob Hawke a hero for it and Tony Abbott a villian! Of course #qanda
Don't work with kids, animals or #qanda audiences.
dave hughes to talk about the serious issues on #qanda - possibly the funniest thing he's ever done?
#qanda @QandA Oz should not have to take muslims immigrants and have to de-radicalise them to fit in, take ppl who fit and who r peaceful
Alcohol is classified as a group 1 carcinogen. Watch for the future cancer epidemic #QandA
Workcover has harmed hundreds and hundreds but that's never spoken about.  #qanda
Get over it! These are terrorists not Muslim extremists #qanda
I'm not sure that a solution to access mental health professionals in schools is to replace them with Chaplains.  #qanda
@QandA For God's sake the child is here, we have a responsibility to care for him.
Move to the country #qanda
#qanda Departments have rules, but a Minister usually has discretionary powers to overrule them... as TJones just said!! Snap!!
Use public transport in New York or London then come back to Melbourne &amp; you realise how awful ours is #qanda
We need more than strong leadership; we need to return to human values, all of us #qanda
#QandA Victoria is never going to end up with any decent infrastructure Andrews has made sure of that for all future Governments
@QandA Don't shift funding it, reproduce it. #qanda
great to see the Muslim community represented on tonights panel #qanda
#Anzac #qanda We aren't all part of "the fabric" I am AUSTRALIAN I have no interest in Muslim being a big part of our cultural conversation
Ever notice that racial tensions always hit a peak when the LNP is in part? Coincidence? No, it's actually not. #qanda
We need to do more to destigmatise mental illness in Australia. Lives are depending on it. #qanda
Wouldn't be the same without LNP taking a dig at #ausunions #qanda
Well said Ethan! #qanda
Job HAD to be cancelled #Qanda
I love liberal alarmist conspiracy theories  #qanda
Extremism has grown under Abbott Govt. It's no accident #qanda
Because regional Victorians can't get public transport. #qanda
Nice to see our youngsters pitching in. This kid deserves a medal. #qanda

@drkerrynphelps #qanda nonsense. One is far more likely to be killed by a spouse or vehicle or a wayward hot air balloon piloted by a cow.
Depression needs to be renamed to reflect what it really is. It is not just simply feeling depressed or down  @QandA #qanda
@QandA We allow war torn fled, a new start however they continue living the same when Australia &amp; Australians accepted them in.
I blame Twitter. Specifically my tweets  #QandA
Say thanks to families who put in so much support for those with mental health issues #qanda
Fascinating discussion bringing mental health challenges to the forefront @QandA @yawcrc
"shit happens" #QandA
#QandA @QandA The questioner should be blaming @michaelobrienmp who signed up to the dodgy contract. People out of cars reduces congestion!
#qanda mental illness a bigger killer than terrorism
#qanda Dave Hughes is right we all bleed red blood
Vegan extremists!?? What's extreme about being against animal cruelty? #QandA
Isn't there a link between alcohol and domestic violence? Domestic murder? #qanda
Blergh what a simplistic understanding of the issue the panel is showing #qanda
Speaking up Ethan and giving voice for important issues #qanda @QandA
#QandA Why's all Islam blamed for acts by some. Why aren't all Christians blamed for Iraq invasion.Bush said God told him to do it. #auspol
That was the most beautiful, humble and generous question I've heard so far on #qanda
@QandA When will ppl realize Andrews won with a mandate to spend on Rail not road.
Without #qanda Tyrone would have been deported - team Australia or what
A small monetary burden on all of us should be a no issue to save a life! No to deportation. Minister makes the right decision @QandA #qanda
Private event or not. Everyone has a camera on their phone. This was absolutely a stunt! #QandA
Telling school children who are suicidal to read the Bible is not an effective solution #qanda
Mental health is a community challenge #qanda
#qanda Tony was a bit cute when he was directing the rowdy crowd :)
If you experience depression, you have to talk about it. Isolation feeds the beast. #mentalhealth #qanda
Mental illness does not make anyone weak, or incapable, or less intelligent. It promotes resilience and mental toughness #qanda #ruok
Australians will vote for a man that may well be sending children into lives as child prostitues. #qanda
Our rights about to be signed away with the #TPPA and #qanda wastes time on Abbott's beer!
Abbotts a dangerous drunk #qanda
Lay off Abbott. We're Australian for gods sake. #qanda
Abbott is simply haaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrd. Oh, and probably thirsty. #QandA
Litmus test for hipsters?? #qanda
Me too! @urallagirl: I'm with the kid. This is just wrong!  #qanda
@QandA Disaffected young people have always been attracted to cults, gangs or subversive groups of some sort
#QandA The Abbott government would have to be creating more depression and feelings of hopelessness than any government in our history.
This sounds bad because it is bad, @AndrewRobbMP #qanda
Alcohol is not a problem. Alcoholism is. And we need to deal with it. 20 years ago. #QandA
Lots of empty seats on #qanda - looks like an NRL match!
Didn't Victorians vote against the east-west link #qanda
Public transport and the NBN. If we had a visionary government than that is what they'd be spending money on. #qanda
#qanda I am sick and tired of hearing the system let people down, personal and family accountability folks.

All this government does is talk. No policy no action Andrew #qanda @QandA
We live in one of the world's most successful democracies. It's hard to imagine there are still stigmas on concern issues. #qanda
Dave Hughes always knows how to set the story straight #qanda
@QandA People living with mental illness aren't your inspiration porn. #qanda
#QandA is looking promising. Tony Jones has stopped asking questions, and let the panel have a discussion.
@QandA  muslim radicalism is a concern but so is ozzie radicalism #qanda
#qanda @DHughesy the only sensible one knows to keep religion in his heart not on his tongue! #peace
We don't need a leader. We need to help each other whilst the pollies decide about our mental health. #qanda
Ice has only now become an epidemic? It's been an epidemic for years, everyone's chosen to ignore it #qanda
#qanda  https://t.co/kknpiEmLBg

Terrorism false flag media propaganda #qanda
If these 'radicalized youths weren't over there, they be in gangs on our streets #qanda
This makes me angry! Why isn't Oz helping PPL who have asked for help?  It's an int'l tragedy. #qanda
This government won't get serious on mental health until the IPA does. #qanda
#Qanda if the LNP could find a way to privatise depression they'd be in like a shot
Don't insult the vegans, Anna. You are in Melbourne after all #qanda
#QandA leader of Victorian Muslims said men should not have been arrested but counselled! Isn't it up to their community to also protect us?
Onya Ethan. From the mouths of babes. #qanda
I'M SO THIRSTY! SO, SO THIRSTY! #qanda
How in ONE show we can go from demonising the stigma of mental health, yet discuss deporting a boy for disability? #qanda
Not enough support for non acute illness with need to suicide to get help #qanda
I've always enjoyed Q&amp;A, however Tony Jones is being quite opinionated tonight. #qanda #poorform

Faaaarkkk! Jihadi question first up on #qanda
Take the question on its merits @AndrewRobbMP don't use the excuse that past PM'S did it - it's not always a Labor v Liberal thing #qanda
What role, if any, does the government have in creating this vitriolic, hateful atmosphere? #qanda @qanda
Cracking panel on Qanda tonight! #qanda
#qanda deportation on the grounds of disability is disgusting. Blaming the "rules" on the govt department is pathetic and a cop out.

@Rowans_Graffiti Yes someone tell Robb that their community is his community and he is a paid leader #qanda
It's the previous governments fault for signing the contract two weeks before an election #qanda
oh goodness #QandA looks like a 'nope' fest tonight
@qanda gotta love Anna
Most important thing if you are depressed or having thoughts of self harm- speak to someone about it- help is available #qanda
#QandA great question
The stigma around mental illness is disappearing precisely because those like Robb are brave enough to speak out about it #qanda
We should celebrate our multiculturalism and diversity #qanda
As a working mum I hate traffic too. #QandA
Great role modelling @AndrewRobbMP #qanda
Tony Abbott has to go. Back to UK. #QandA
How can @AndrewRobbMP question then economic modelling around #EWLink. It's in the report!! #qanda
Qanda Qanda Qanda Qanda Qanda Qanda Qanda Qanda ewwww Hughesy #qanda
Now Andrew Robb understands the trauma of depression will he advocate for the people being tormented in Australian detention centres? #qanda
i made this twitter account to tell u to understand what Jihad means  before u use the word - its not a holy war, its inner struggle. #qanda

R U OK? #ujcomm2657 @QandA
Time to tweet #qanda aka time to boil with rage and mash the keyboard in a futile attempt to communicate my displeasure with the government!
@QandA people who are depressed sometimes kill themselves? #qanda
Did #qanda really just display that Cronulla riots tweet!
Robb, this was a political exercise by napthine, and when Victorians opposed it he wrote the side bar which we are paying for.   #qanda
Always talk about saving the environment by not driving cars and using public transport but there's no money being put into it #qanda
Public transport? Tasmanians don't even know what that means! It doesn't exist in any real reliable form down here! #QandA #auspol
Is someone going to ask how long until Eurovision? @qanda #qanda

Hello Sunday Morning is a terrific initiative. It's not about quitting drinking, but figuring out why you drink @QandA
David Hughes is so stupid. He is a perfect, brainless candidate to be recruited by Isis #qanda
#qanda Andrews was voted in based on his stance on this road wasn't he? Therefore majority must not want it
Disappointing that Aboriginal Australians aren't being mentioned in this discussion, they are six times more likely to commit suicide #qanda
#qanda When did Jones become participant and not moderator. Andrews is right, Government can't just give every lobby group there wishes.
Oh get the other boot in Robb, former Lib party secretary smear and fear #qanda
I love it when we break down the stigma of #depression. #QandA
#qanda Maybe if we stop focusing on wars fought 100 years ago we could shift funds to the urgent suicide and critical ice situations in AUS.
Mr Robb is the perfect example of someone dealing with depression and still succeeding in the workplace #qanda
If the people obviously want it, they should get it. #qanda

we should teach kids about all religions including islam in school. why is only christianity taught in public schools? #qanda
Let's not forget that the last terrorism arrests involved confiscating a plastic sword. #qanda
Love Dave Hughes. Funny guy. But why is anyone expecting a comedian to know how to solve ethnic tensions in Australian community? #qanda
Martin Square?! #qanda
Sleep study people tried to get me to turn off #qanda to go to sleep. No!
Australians get killed from domestic violence an order of magnitude more than terrorism! Lets get out priorities right here #auspol #QandA
#qanda not up to schools to educate about different religions
Tony Abbott skolled his first drink after finally removing his feet from his mouth. #qanda
This is why Abbott launched an ice task force but not an alcahol one @qanda #qanda
Mental health is a National Health Priority Area! It's not all doom and gloom #qanda
@QandA Australians are lame when it comes to protests, if they hit the streets, take note, they're passionate.
This #qanda just got hyper-local. Something about Hoddle St and Middlevale Rd.

Roads vs Rail: Why won't the Federal Government fund public transport infrastructure projects? #QandA http://t.co/NiLXmh8Azo
Funding 4 mental health services in jeopardy. Some primary health services contracted out to for-profit private health insurers #qanda
Fundamentalists and extremism do not (and never will) represent the the majority. No need to be fearful. #QandA #auspol
It wasn't the Labor Govt's fault that the Liberal Govt wrote the cheques and signed the contracts on a dodgy deal. We didn't want it! #QandA

Does everyone in Sydney subjecting themselves to  qanda know that the Great Southern has $4 spirits night at the same time?
Seems crazy Islamophobia is an issue, why not use this anger against domestic violence, that is really unAustralian! #qanda
Coalition won't act on the report. Wait for Labor to gain power for action to occur! Like all other major reform. #qanda
waste waste waste #qanda discrimination against the west
Mental illness is not a lifestyle choice. Neither is the poverty &amp; homelessness too many are stuck in. #qanda
Depression is a disease, not a choice and it needs to be addressed that way. We have an epidemic on our hands. #qanda @QandA
See the eyes... No politics, just really honest dialogue... #qanda
Have Dave Hughes done any coke lately?! Pffft! #qanda #hypocrites @pfh007
Footballers and skolling beer .. What could go wrong ? #qanda

Anna Anna Anna!!! #QandA
#qanda FFS Tony, control the plonkers in the audience and let the speakers finish!
Suicide and domestic violence kill more Aussies in a week than at home terrorism does in a year. So, why don't we care? #qanda
#qanda A Robb plant surely.
Something needs to be done on the disaffected people who are giving up hope, becoming antisocial and joining the young liberals. #QandA
Ugh. #qanda  https://t.co/SN2LVncImZ

Can we have a litmus test against dickheads? @QandA
#RESPECT to @YAWCRC CEO @janeburns for promoting tolerance, valuing diversity and young people's voices.  #qanda
I hate the word tolerance too. it's acceptance we need, we need to be appreciative and accepting #qanda
Dismiss Murdoch media &amp; watch the radicalising of empowered Australians. #qanda
I hear the Labor party will be floating the super fast train up the east side of Australia again at the next election #qanda
If @QandA are gonna talk about Other cultures they need those cultures represented on the panel #noBiase #qanda
Robb a tad defensive of the fearless leader #qanda
Drinking problems with #qanda - watching it sober.
Succeed is the wrong word to talk about a person committing suicide #qanda
We need more kids or people all together like Ethan #QandA
If you listen very carefully you can hear Minister Andrew Robb seamlessly insert fear-mongering dog whistles into everything he says #qanda
Awesome question Ethan @QandA  #qanda
Derryn Hinch "being cautious" about matters before the court... #qanda
If there is extra-terrestrial intelligence, could they teach us to effectively deal with society's woes? #QandA
Tony Abbott is Prime minister, how many people can say that? #qanda
See. Cars. Roads. Public transport. Lovely. Philosophical even. #qanda
#qanda will be arguing over @TonyAbbottMHR drinking beer when an Australian is beheaded.

Does Tony Abbott's road building extremism count? #QandA
It's also important to address mental health disorders in youth and young teenagers. Suicide is not a joke #QandA
Surprise surprise, a sitting-politician-free episode of #qanda has the least rhetoric and the most insight.
Yes! #actnow don't need another year of advocacy, talks, reports! #qanda
Can't wait to see Anna Bourke on #qanda tonight
five years at high school two people from my high school commited suicide and I've personally had to call the police for a friend #qanda
Hard to talk about diversity with such a white panel #qanda
#qanda - He's not cost you 400million - he's just saved you billions! Get it?
people decide because  they can't see your problem like a broken arm that it isn't a problem #qanda
#qanda what a honest and brave answer. Great stuff Andrew Robb. great Stuff indeed!!
Hmmm. #qanda
How about @TonyAbbottMHR get up and denounce the white fascists of Reclaim Australia. Deradicalise the white people. #qanda

To quote Hannibal Lecter, why complete the arch and complete the Ring Road? #qanda
Maybe if we treat vulnerable people in detention with kindness &amp; compassion, there would be less concern around future pain &amp; trauma #qanda
Reclaim Australia would fail the litmus test for sure. Let's talk about them. #qanda
You should represent our country to all Mr Hinch! #QandA
#qanda @qanda is it something to do with human needs being seen as secondary to the economy's needs? Is that why we're depressed?
If the Liberals were serious about spending money sensibly, they wouldn't be pushing a project with 45 cents return on the dollar. #qanda
So A government gets voted in because it promises it won't build a road and Hinch believes that actually the people really want it #qanda
Australia is a developed country, how about suicides in developing countries? #qanda
Education about drugs and alcohol needs to be stepped up #qanda
Is Jane's microphone really broken, or does she just not have any input? #qanda
we need to do to reduce the stigma is to stop using the words around casually, only say it when you mean it #qanda
"normal" dangerous choice of words for a politician #QandA
#qanda They fixed the rail in Newcastle. Totally stuffed access to the CBD and Beach. All in the name of cash.
@RepSean Do you think the moderator knew &amp; let it go anyway? Irresponsible by #qanda editor.
Great question to @AndrewRobbMP on #depression #qanda
Why should we care about this? #qanda
The only time liberals are OK is when they are sick #qanda
Good on Andrew Robb for shedding light on this horrible mental illness. @qanda
The recommendation that $1Billion b shifted to local communities to deal w mental illness is a good idea - so the gov doesn't like it #qanda
PROTEST. #qanda
#qanda school psychologists? we have chaplain's now they're ... much better @AndrewRobbMP as long as you believe in God
Great to see my local politician Anna Burke on #QandA tonight
Consultations and reports are excuses to not do something. Govt must act now #QandA
What? Was that a question? #qanda
Let's discuss Julie Bishop's choice of clothing this week @QandA. I'm open to this discussion having visited several Muslim countries
Might have helped to have someone from the Muslim community on the panel to answer these questions. #qanda
We need to look at mental illness as an illness! Not a lifestyle choice or anything less #qanda
Having lived in Europe for years, Public Transport in Australia is incredibly backwards. I totally support improving it asap. #qanda
So fantastic to hear about mums helping kids with depression and alcohol and abuse #qanda Great panel!!!!!

Most alcoholism/addiction is part of mental illness #qanda
Robb&amp;Hinch getting the lions share of #qanda tonite. Anna had a chance to speak about the crook Speaker yet? Now that wld be interesting.
I lost a dear friend to #suicide last month after 25yrs of checking in with him to see he was ok. Plays on my mind all the time now #qanda

The mental health access plan prohibits people with mental illness who are not very wealthy from accessing good mh support #qanda

The government is fixated with roads because the government is forever looking backward and not forward. #QandA
Mental health - Australia's greatest opportunity for investment. Let's prioritise all our mental health! #qanda
Part of stopping radicalisation would probably be the government not actively making Islam the enemy. #qanda

Why can't we have a bipartisan,  round house table from all the mental health advocacy groups,politicians to come up with solution? #qanda
Where are the sweeping anti-terror raids to prevent the most pernicious form of terrorism in this country: violence against women? #qanda
I think watching #qanda and the news and seeing just how screwed up the world is could be a leading cause of depression.
This whole thing about me having a drink with the boyz at the local is silly because we hit up the cross after. #qanda #drinkswiththeboys

bob hawke: stop trying to be me tony #qanda
@QandA you don't 'commit' suicide. It's not illegal.
Addressing mental health issues seriously would address homelessness, unemployment, drug abuse and so on #QandA
@QandA Take ownership as a community and connect with our sons, brothers and fathers.  What are you doing to help?
hahahahahaha They dont have the 'capacity' to build rail you dork because rail crosses state lines. One state cant do it #qanda
Great answer Andrew Robb. I wish the PM would start to realise how he is impacting the mental health of those on Manus &amp; Nauru #qanda
Sport, masculinity and alcohol are inextricably linked in Australian culture. Not to mention violence #qanda
Excellent #qanda moment. Great discussion on #depression.
Umm, trade minister... You shouldn't reveal anything about ASIO investigations. Or do you want to be jailed for 10 years? #qanda
Interesting mix of panelists and debate on #QandA tonight!

Great message from Dave Hughes delivered with humour for a laugh but spot on #qanda #hughesyisspecial
This is a (surprisingly) deep and valuable look at some important issues surrounding mental health #qanda http://t.co/dXR78zrN6I
We need to stop using the word "admit" when talking about mental illness and depression #qanda @QandA
Time to gag #QandA
Bloody Greens and their bloody communist public transport! Where will it end? #qanda
"it's a complicated issue....what do you think, Dave Hughes?" #qanda
#qanda Bob Hawke was on a beer drip most of his life, Tony Abbott has ONE schooner, and the lefty whiners just can't help themselves!
Do #qanda panelists get paid? Asking for a friend.
@HumanHeadline making sense on #qanda but, surprise, nobody applauding.
Building a great road doesnt mean public transport will miss out! #qanda

Islamaphobia on social media certainly makes young Muslims feel isolated and vilified. It doesn't help #qanda
Drinking used to be the cherry on top for victory. Now it's just the whole cake. #QandA
Oh my God, Tony said they were gonna discuss the TPP and then they totally didn't! ABC is in on the conspiracy! #IlluminatiConfirmed #QandA
#QandA wake up people. #ISIS is the monster created by #America! Their goal is to destablise countries that oppose #Israel and #Saudi Arabia
We need to be a society thats okay to struggle - its human! #QandA

Only PM until you lead the UN? #Kevin17? #QandA
More Muslim bashing on #qanda tonight. Don't take such ridiculous questions Tony.
#QandA Unfortunately medication is not effective for everyone. Be great if it was, but management is also necessary for some.
@NDISyesADHCyes @QandA great to hear some hecklers.
@qanda Robb just made depression a problem to keep secret
All the #transport engineers agree that better public transport is what relieves congestion NOT more roads @QandA #qanda
#qanda Depressed contact Beyond Blue
By 2020 depression will be the 2nd leading health problem. We need to take prevention and maintenance seriously. #qanda
What a darling! #qanda
Arsehole first question. #qanda
Litmus goes either blue or red. Liberal or Labor. #qanda
Public figures like @AndrewRobbMP speaking candidly about depression are a critical part of fighting the stigma around mental illness #qanda
Cronulla riots "legitimate self-defense"??!  The American spelling says it all. #QandA
Respect Robb! Great insights and techniques on dealing with depression. #qanda
What about depression in indigenous communities ? #qanda
Anna Burke - well said! Prevention always better than cure @QandA #qanda
#qanda Restore the session numbers for psych consultations under mental health care plans!
#ISIS has to be crushed. The way the Nazis were. #qanda

Well said @DHughesy Yours is the story of so many people - not just 'boys'. #rolemodel #truth #greatmum! #qanda
It's sad that the minister only acts when the case gets public attention. #qanda
Lets open the bowling with an over of muslim bashing. #qanda #auspol
@QandA Anna, hijab wearers at Unimelb &amp; in the city no way look like they are fearful. Australia is not the cause. #QandA

I long for the day when rednecks fear walking the streets with F-Off we're full stickers!!   #Qanda
#QandA Ice is a symptom of of a bigger problem. There are deeper issues that need to be addressed before substance abuse will ease
No one going to mention that 80% of those suicides are men? #QandA #AusPol
Reviews and inquiries into mental illness can only take us so far - we need action now! #qanda
Refugees are a global problem too Robb, but Australia says not in my backyard #qanda
Social media = islamophobia = extremism? What strange logic #QandA
#QandA Hospital mental health units are bursting at the seams
This #qanda relates so well to our #ujcomm2657 classes today.

More of this. Less of the last half hour. #qanda

Do you think there could be a link between radicalised young people and depression? #qanda
Bit of a joke watching the all white panel on #qanda talk about Muslims/Islam.
Andrew Robb the man trying to bring in the TPP and sell out Australia to the corporations - Shame you should be kicked out #qanda

Thank you @AndrewRobbMP spoken like a true sufferer recovering with help. 'Keep a dancing' on the Black Dog! #qanda
The problem was the previous government signing the contracts just before the election #qanda
Watch Robb squirm on this. #qanda
being skewered by your mates will generally bring on depressive episodes #qanda
Drinking in our society has gotten worse than when Hawke was a Uni student. Bringing Hawke into the discussion is a moot point #QandA
Radical actions from a simple book. @QandA
Maybe the government could fund mental health professionals rather than chaplains for example #qanda
Why are some young Muslims disenchanted to have their heads filled with garbage #qanda
Ah yes the good old days of drinking #qanda
.@janeburns discusses the failings of the mental health care system &amp; key recommendations in the report #QandA http://t.co/JYq4HCmfs9
I'm so bored with this Puritanism. #qanda
Great that a leading Australian politician is talking so candidly about depression. It's not something to be kept in the dark. #QandA
Reality is Fiberals don't like anything public - education, health, transport, detention centres. #qanda
At least you have a rail system. Not everyone is so lucky #QandA
I love it when the #qanda crowd gets a bit bolshy

I can't see Obama going a skol!? #qanda
Religion is poisonous to the mind. #qanda

@QandA Muslim leaders need to speak up in large numbers denouncing terrorism #qanda
If we put more goods on trains, we wouldn't need to repair the roads as much as we do #QandA
The Vic government's cancelling of that contract is like losing a deposit on a car you realised you can't afford. #QandA
.@RitaPanahi a troll account of yours just popped up on #qanda
It's ridiculous that this stigma still exists. We don't judge or mock other illnesses. Why does that not extend to mental health? #qanda
The toughest guy in the pub is the one who says 'No I've had enough', true words @DHughesy #qanda
@QandA all this talk about depression is depressing me
@qanda #qanda The 'ice epidemic' needs a task force. Does the alcohol epidemic need a task force?

Terrible. Just terrible. How many times can the "administration' be blamed as if the system is fixed in stone? #qanda
@DarrylSmith42 all g! #qanda is for learning :) insulin can help diabetes. anti-depressants can help mental illness. Our brain gets sick too
Ahhh!  Robb had access to good care... unlike most Australians suffering similarly.   #qanda
#qanda Good to hear from reformed drinkers Hughsey and Hinch.
Tony Abbott likes a shandy and an onion. Both are a strange combination to appeal to voters. #qanda
Rail is the worlds best land based transport system ever built!!! #qanda
People won't tell their boss about mental illness because they're afraid they might lose their career #qanda

@Kon__K Kon the unemployed? #qanda

@QandA so we all agree that mental health is so important, so why does govt cut funding to it? Shouldn't  we support mental health programs
@QandA featuring @HumanHeadline and his plethora of bogus opinions..#qanda

My workplace tries so hard to be supportive of mental health but it doesn't mean I'm comfortable discussing it with my manager. #qanda
You're forgetting the Labor promise that it wouldn't cost taxpayers a cent to tear up the contract. #QandA
We all need to keep asking #QandA about the TPP. Precisely because they're NOT discussing it. Keep asking. Persist. Insist. ADDRESS THE TPP!
the words "normal" &amp; "them" defeats the purpose of everything #qanda
Meanwhile in Sydney #qanda #roads http://t.co/yTQQps7MEH

This talk of depression is depressing me, I'm getting another drink of wine #QandA
#qanda After seeing this appreviation here for years...I finally deciphered it's meaning: question and ask.
#qanda @qanda Federal government also needs to take responsibility for their impact on radicalisation
#qanda @qanda males in public roles are heroes when they admit depression. Women with the same problem are too weak to be taken seriously
@leftocentre How do people like him even manage to get elected?! #qanda
Forget supply. All we will have are horror stories about ice use...if we don't address factors to reduce demand #qanda
Liberals got the jobs for unions, labour cancel the job for free money. Even labour voters want it #paidupalready #freebie #qanda

Non muslims like Robb acting like they know what is best for muslim communities in tackling radcalisation. What irony. #QandA
What a terrible question #qanda
#qanda tolerence n acceptance needs to work both ways
We need to make a happy pill #qanda
#qanda silencing democracy in the studio right now - @AndrewRobbMP let's talk about the #TPP #WhySoSecret? http://t.co/YpsNLrfwcB
Would like to hear more about how he still says he would be more silent because the stigma of a past illness follows him.  #qanda
Right, let's jump into #QandA, 30 minutes delayed. Total arse-suckery.
Better public transport is good for tradies, easing pressure on the road for those that NEED to use them. #qanda
Any evidence that Beyond Blue does anything but promote the lie that #LNP can make up for its cuts to mental health care? #qanda #auspol

#QandA @QandA Build a one way rail track from Canberra to the middle of the NT once politicians reach their use by date
Darryl should understand the role of Presumption of innocence  #qanda
"ex-convict derryn hinch..." #qanda
Shall we file Andrew Robb's little dissertation on Abbott's beer under forgettable and fumbled? #qanda
So TPP demonstrators get on #qanda and they're politely laughed at, yet students protest and they're openly mocked and silenced?

Extreme views are not necessarily wrong People are human with differing beliefs mostly inbred some original Examine before quashing #qanda
@Monaro_Sheepo @QandA wow you're so funny , you belong in a cage
@QandA your last discussion about mental illness you did not provide any mental health hotlines. I can only hope tonight that you do #qanda
Employers still target with impunity those with mental health issues for redundancy or termination. #qanda
I stopped commenting but have to express my disbelief that qanda can't move away from Muslims! #qanda

Yes, stop those terrorist attacks planned by vegans! #qanda

Problem of false equivalency among #qanda tweet selectors strikes again. https://t.co/nW5pabopSa
Got some characters in the #QandA audience tonight. Are they in Frankston or Collingwood?
Fear is laid as much at the feet of the "leaders" of the gov a s anyone else. #qanda
#qanda Go, Dave!

#qanda Robb does not speak a word of truth.
Prevalence of racism is high in Australia - ask any non Caucasian #qanda
However, we must remember that anxiety goes hand in hand with #depression #qanda
#qanda not working on iview. Again.
#qanda Tony Abbott isn't just irresponsible - he's an idiot.
To the #EWlink questioner a road with a cost benefit ratio of 0.45 should not be built. #qanda
I am absolutely not special.  #thanksDave #QandA
The panel seems thirsty #qanda
Just stop being vile, you brutes. #qanda
Now you all know.  #QandA
The impact of alcohol on society is greater than all other drugs combined. #qanda

#qanda Developing employment in outer suburbs and encouraging telecommuting will reduce pressure on roads.
Australia is very good at sweeping the issue of suicide under the rug. it starts with awareness #qanda
@QandA Social cohesion and social participation the responsibility of everyone, not just old school Australians
Tony Abbott should have been thrown out of this country years ago #qanda
Cheers! #qanda
#qanda need to embrace and truly support #diversity!
The inability of people with a disability to participate equally is an indictment on our institutions and cultures that exclude them. #qanda
wowsers  #qanda
#qanda Depression is an illness like any other, and should be treated as such
It appears that Dave Hughes may be a little out of his depth tonight @QandA
As a person with a sibling who is autistic. Deporting an autistic child will do nothing but cause long term damage on all involved #qanda
@james_powditch @qanda You need to listen to something cheerful like Megan Washington, James. ;)
If terrorists killed 7 people a day, I don't think we'd be worrying about which govt portfolio had responsibility. #QandA
Nooo! Is there a drinking culture in Australia? #qanda
@DunneBreen @QandA @Fluffula Not a word about Mad Dog Jones inciting same.
Bob Hawke was made a legend for skolling a beer but those same people make judgments of Tony Abbott.. Complete double standards #qanda
Aren't all these panelists white middle class wealthy people ????? #qanda
Anyone up in arms over a fake tweet airing on #QandA should be livid over the FTA TV ads that include made up quotes from fake accounts.
Probably not the worst case of government money wastage in history, but bad anyway! #QandA
#QandA medical cannabis helped me with my depression.
Cut the retirement tax breaks for the millionaires cut neg gearing and spend on managing health before hospitalisation. #QandA
The nazis started as a small group, not taken seriously, catapulted to to power through scapegoating a people.  #QandA
#QandA With 7 governments plus federal government it is near impossible for AU to have an effective national mental illness program.
Hinch needs to be careful not to prejudice the trial, oh  #qanda
#qanda we are all the same go Dave.
#QandA People are better when they are free to individually easily move about, not when they're dependent on government transportation.
#qanda 100 years ago a whole bunch of Aussies went to fight in Turkey. What's changed
#QandA I want what Andrew Robb is on.
Don't leave it until it's too late- start the conversation! #mentalhealthau #qanda
Stereotyping is dangerous, no matter what group is in the sights. #qanda
@qanda. Dead societies drink because there is nothing else. This is a dead society.
#qanda note to everyone, muslims are a diverse group, not represented by one self appointed leader, its a complex problem.
Let me guess? Qantas is frightened of a bullet train and is paying the LNP big donations to keep the bullet train dead. #qanda
We'll take your skilled labour, but not your special needs kid - for shame, Australia, for shame. #qanda
Amazing to hear these stories and I am glad to to see the older generation are talking about it #qanda
Haven't had drink for 15 years and life's great #qanda
"It's a really tough one" thanks Hughesy great take #qanda
Conservatives and media fuel fear #QandA
@RunawayBudgie I think she said "Why won't #qanda put my tweets on screen?"
Yeah who do we think we are? #qanda
#Australia might have a different name 200 years from now and then our descendants don't have to worry about what #Australian means #qanda
I don't understand why the issue of Islamic extremism keeps getting watered down by comparisons to other irrelevant issues...#qanda @QandA
Depression is an illness that people don't need to remain quiet about, get help, live life again! #qanda
@markeystarkey when servicing the economy is considered more important than people's needs. Yes there's a lot in that #qanda
No ones building inner city freeways, more cities over the world are ripping them out. More rail for our cities &amp; rural areas. #qanda
Would have been nice if #qanda panel were people who understand the Quran and its followers motives.
#qanda LOL. Please share your POV of racism.
How much has already been spent on melbourne metro rail? It had been around as an idea longer than #ewlink #qanda
Bring on the federal election get rid of these shameless conservatives #qanda
Jane Burns is the most narcissistic person I have ever seen on television #qanda
@Warbz and I have both been featured on the twitter feed tonight #laborstaffersrepresent #qanda
Yep. #QandA https://t.co/wL6JBEaqK8
Strannge..the Abbott Govt doesn't seem worried about the damage to our international reputation from their climate obstructionism #qanda
#QandA Shock, horror! Andrew Robb has a point. 40 years ago WE were more welcoming and Turkish Muslims who came then don't feel alienated.
Poor Dave Hughes doesn't get the Koran. We are not all the same. #dimwit #qanda
Huge respect to @AndrewRobbMP for speaking about his personal experience with depression. Every contribution helps to reduce stigma #qanda
Wouldn't you rather the money spent on something that will work #qanda
Again, anyone interested in reading more about what this discussion about depression is on about, read Michael Foucault. #qanda
Question 1. WAT #qanda
Anna Burke is on #qanda tonight. :)
@RitaPanahi @QandA At least you got your face on tely.... #abcFAIL
Nothing that prime minister does surprises me @DHughesy #qanda
Fair go, he just needed to wash down an onion #QandA
@QandA #qanda Outta the mouths of babes...
#qanda yet when someone needs help it takes at least two months to get an appointment with a psychiatrist.That is unacceptable!
HUGHESYYYYY! #qanda
Just, like, don't be bigots, y'know? #qanda
Wishy washy politcal correctness on the panel tonight. At least @HumanHeadline has the balls to call it as it is. #qanda
This #qanda has got me thirsty....for insightful discussion!
Once again guilty. #qanda #springst http://t.co/X09iWGXkIq
#auspol #qanda Some regard Robb as one of Abbott Govt's better performers.Tell you something?
One punch Abbott after a shandy #qanda
Its an important topic. But this is a little dull now. #qanda
First time Derryn is being careful of the courts #qanda
#QandA keep the taxes on our shores to pay for the funding required for the grow mental health  organisations
@QandA @janeburns Make access to therapists easier and cheaper. If someone can't work due to poor mental health, how can they afford help?
Over 20,000 asylum seekers in Australia. Their vulnerability should be a mental health priority  #qanda
Next question please #QandA
I like that @DHughesy doesn't have the answers. This is a tough issue to solve - and we're all responsible for it. #QandA
#qanda @QandA u don't want to end up with people suiciding in Oz, like failed policy of cattle export under labour which was a knee jerk
People need to recognise the signs of depression in others.  #QandA
Should you wish to seek some assistance, #QandA please contact:
Extremists do not represent moderates #qanda @QandA
We should commission an inquiry into how the legal system could better serve Derryn Hinch #qanda
@janeburns makes a critical point. Any solution to a challenging problem must be multi dimensional - at the policy &amp; community level #QandA
Martin square???? Wow... It's a true Mexican panel tonight... #qanda
Alas, health services in regional areas in this country cannot deal with the issues that mental health brings with it. #qanda
Deporting the boy sounds terrible because it IS terrible Andrew Robb #qanda
Anna Burke - back to form. Defending Labor waste. What a relief. #qanda
Yes light rail down eastern freeway is the way to go #qanda
let me guess, the government's solution is to centralise and privatise #qanda
Should our Eurovision song be "alchool is free"? Sorry greece!   #QandA
Whew!  Hughesie gets a lighter question and relaxes at last. #QandA
Hinch wants everyone kept in gaol longer - except himself #QandA
@QandA #qanda 10 points Andrew Robb! Thanks for sharing your challenge #mentalhealth
A child with autism can survive alone for 5 days in the bush .. better than any politician I would hazard a guess #qanda
For someone who works in the helping/listening professions, that woman sure does interrupt a lot ! @QandA #QandA
#qanda Minister's discretion is "so good" it gets tested in the high court!
If you take away a persons reason for life. you leave them with nothing. Gov need to do more.   #qanda
#qanda @QandA Koori law is a necessity as indigenous peoples need protection and autonomy
Refreshing #qanda ep w/o constant interruptions pushing political agendas!
Yes, the stigma is still there. #mentalhealth #qanda
@Tigerwhite1977 RoCo on the #qanda twitter account tonight.
adrew robbs openness is the kind of action that will help to de-stigmatise mental illness #qanda
@QandA make the right decision*
You CAN take you kids on public transport! #qanda
@QandA don't talk broken promise.  Your leaders broken all his #andrewrobb #qanda
#qanda re depression; the stigma may be there but the funding sure isn't!
Gosh imagine if we had as much public discourse on Tony's terrible policy as we did on his terrible PR stunts. #qanda
People like Ethan remind me that our country in the future is going to be in safe hands. #qanda
@Rita_Panahi ? Oh well played @QandA. #ParodyIsTheBest
@LearnKotch even more broadly, public funds need to be thoughtfully and respectfully spent and managed #QandA
Tonight's @qanda #qanda reinforced the secrecy surrounding the Trans-Pacific Partnership #TPP #TPPA, failing to tackle the topic at all.
Interesting and obviously desperate tactics to cure a taboo disease #qanda
Here comes the shoe #qanda
Lets stop referring to people with disabilities as 'burdens' on society @qanda #qanda
If Abbott would stop stirring division, perhaps the extremism and raids would stop.  #qanda
Amazing that an accomplished politician would wait DECADES to seek help. The shame attached to mental health treatment is the battle #qanda
If Muslims needs to speak out against Jihadists, I await Christians speaking out Westboro Baptist Church. #qanda
Most people come into the CBD, not via the east west link to the airport #qanda
How many #qanda viewers are having a drink right now?
You just smoked too many cones you idiot. You didn't have schizophrenia. Sheesh #qanda
Tony Abbott should stop the cuts #qanda
The Trans-Pacific Partnership promises a copyright crackdown, which will threaten internet freedom across the world. #TPP #TPPA #qanda
Hopefully the kids can bring the change we need. #qanda
One of the wealthiest and safest nation on earth with daily 65 suacide attempts, 7 been successfull #qanda whats missing?
#qanda friendship over fear
#qanda Hopefully Andrew Robb's employees get the same understanding extended to them as he extends for himself.
Heavy drinking was in fact much worse in Australia 'back in the day.' #qanda
Aus is a Christian country! Why change? #qanda
Every situation is different. Sometimes, for a myriad of reasons, it may be best for a boss not to know. #qanda
Let's just put that half a billion cheque into helping people with mental illnesses #qanda
Is it true the #qanda audience has Jazz Hands plants?
The Vic Govt is keeping its promise made before the election not to build the #EWLink #auspol #springst Should they break it? #qanda
#qanda alcohol is a huge problem yet is revered. How can this be good for our culture?
#QandA must be the number one show on TV!
#qanda @QandA white people can't talk about 'reclaiming' Australia
@Marcdawson @QandA I thought the same
Headspace is fine, but it doesn't work for everyone. And lately it's been seen as a fix for most young people. #qanda
It wasn't so much the drinking as the pandering to a rowdy crowd. #QandA
The audience should keep quiet and remain respectful. #qanda
Egart #qanda
Union scare! #drink It was a sober #qanda until now.
More British Muslims fight in Syria than in UK Armed Forces #qanda
The Minister has the discretion to override the rule #qanda
Is Andrew Robb the best the producers of #QandA could find for tonight?
Bravo Dave Hughes - telling someone what was going on was the first step to recovery. Great message for people #qanda
change the fucking rules. exactly #qanda
Let's hope there's a unity ticket on mental health funding #qanda
Scull skol skoll. The english language is weird #qanda
Everytime a white person does something bad the rest of the white people don't have to come out and say "well that's not like us" #qanda
Headspace is great for mild-mod illness; is NOT wrap around care or for people with severe MI @headspace_aus @QandA @ChrisTantiCEO
Cause school chaplains is such a worthy recipient of govt funding? #QandA
#qanda  Imagine...just imagine the @liberalAus funding health properly and then ... there's Alice in Wonderland...
I'll have an onion martini please #qanda
C'mon everyone knows @DHughesy doesn't drink! #seriously #qanda
Finish the ring road! #problemsolved #QandA
MEDICARE for psychological treatment made Australia world leader in helping people through mental illness @QandA #QandA
#QandA look at all our marvellous 1st world problems! Important but how about govt cutting $11B to #AustralianAid ? Hits the world's poorest
#qanda honest humanity
Gawd. More waffle from Robb. #qanda
#qanda Robbs on top of depression, but how much of his recovery has fired him up to sell of our sovereignty in TPPs. @14luxor @QandA
So @RitaPanahi in case you wanna know #qanda just broadcast a tweet from a fake you. Or was it a fake #qanda?
Huh! Tony Jones has met his match. Try shutting Anna Burke down mate. #qanda
This chick is a drama teacher FOR SURE #qanda
#qanda Robb stirs the fear factor in his first sentence. ... On task, spin merchant.
Anna is 100% right! Do something about it before it happens #qanda
#qanda so Abbott had a beer and is being criticised. Get a life
I really feel like a beer right about now #qanda
You can't stop balding irrelevant sportsmen from saying dumb things. #qanda
we are all in it together. Their problem is our problem and vice versa. #qanda
How do you change our drinking culture when it's #Australia's national brand and Yobbo's are proud of the label. #QandA
@QandA What about mental health in rural towns? The trickle-down effect doesn't happen and stigma is still strong as ever in places #qanda
@QandA save lives -- stuff roads
If those who were detained by the police and later released, are they still guilty? #qanda
This is also why our public health system needs to improve tenfold. #qanda
#qanda Marijuana isn't legal but alcohol is..... why?
Any form of religious or ideological radicalism is a bad thing #qanda
Not a relevant point unless you're taking your three kids to work in the CBD. #qanda
So "all people" must use public transport or their needs are irrelevant according to ALPrep #qanda Govt mandate is govern for all interests
@AndrewRobbMP please push your colleagues to implement the report recs &amp; support those living with mental health issues @QandA #qanda
- Jane Burns #qanda
Europe call boat people MIGRANTS they have some respect for humanity. #qanda
#qanda order!
#qanda how we treat mental health is insufficient
@qanda Jane uses not a lifestyle choice in reference to mental health...hehehehe
With all the passion and drive from the panel tonight, the government is the obvious handbrake, unfortunately. #qanda
Hey @TonyAbbottMHR, want a real crisis to focus on? This is it. #QandA
I'm thirsty #qanda
Take a shot every time a woman is interrupted on #qanda
Call the hinch mob! #qanda
#qanda Yes Stigma still exists, let's applaud workplaces where it's ok to talk about your #mentalhealth
Hawke did it half a century ago. Times have changed. #qanda
Finally a Politician who is willing to call it for what it is! Well said @AndrewRobbMP. Only if there were more like you. #qanda #auspol
Genuine suggestion here, #qanda. Have one person from a minority on the panel each week. You badly need it.
I know for a fact that many bosses don't give a dam if you'e depressed. #qanda
#qanda - credit rating agencies say road cancellation has no impact on AAA credit rating.  Just DON'T build it, clear level xing instead
Looks like these protesters had their signs up the right way at least. #qanda
I don't think this govt likes experts #QandA
What's your definition of extremism, Anna? #qanda
I'm high! #420blazeit #qanda
Start by guaranteeing funding for mental illness into the future #qanda
To many people need help for anyone to care about them personally #qanda
What mental health support is provided to children in detention centres? #qanda
Someone's struggling to answer .. Hmmmm... #qanda @QandA
#qanda well done Andrew Robb but I don't agree with the TPP!
From the crowd that holding signs I could read #ReleasetheTPP #QandA
Hinch proves the excessive alcohol consumption causes memory loss #Qanda
Disaffected, disconnected youth need acceptance &amp; assistance #qanda
#qanda Tony Abbott was trying to wash the taste of onion out of his mouth.
@dailebree Hey, he's not THAT little...(I'm sure he'd say lol) #QandA @QandA
#QandA viewers #BlackRainbow crowd funded it's beginnings for #Indigenous #LGBTI #suicideprevention because no one was addressing our needs.
Andrew Robb. Not a scientologist #qanda
Mental health issues extend further than our cities. Rural areas are overlooked. #qanda
Real, honest and personal insights tonight. Great to see, this takes courage. #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Those numbers are staggering! #QandA
We Australians drink to get drunk. Then, we fight. Our friends, our partners, our children. This must stop. #QandA
@QandA remember those halcyon days when Anna Bourke was the speaker? Bring back those days. #qanda
Ethan wins #qanda tonight #powertothepeople #ethanrocks Our young are our future.
#qanda when will the Muslims take ownership of the terrorist children they have raised ?
@QandA #qanda so Mr Robb, what about fighting for proper funding for mental health programs?
#QandA ha! Port Pirie I was there for about 3 weeks once.They ran me out of town. joke
"Cough splutter, Um Look. Religion's tough" - Hughsey  #QandA
One of our reporters did a story about expectations of Australia and trust us - drinking is expected. Abbott just played to that #qanda
I think the saying "it takes a village to raise a child" is appropriate for today's problems #qanda
@DHughesy on #qanda, as close as we can get to him returning to #theprojecttv?
Terror raids are a great poll booster. #qanda
After a day at uni/work, I don't want to deal with grumpy old men on a crammed train. Let's fix that problem. #qanda

#qanda In Australia now you are guilty unproven innocent. Trial by politicians and media.

@QandA  Stop dancing around and just answer Ethans question #qanda
Shane Warne is an idiot, move on #qanda
Andrew. In this instance the rules must be broken #QandA
Constantly associating drinking with celebration and masculinity is nuts knowing what we do about Australians drinking culture #qanda

@DHughesy good job on #qanda 
Sydney had the cross city tunnel, what a success that's been #qanda
#QandA Will Chemist Warehouse be selling the Litmus Test? Just curious.
Did Andrew Robb discuss setup of Lomborg's climate contrarian consensus centre at UWA in Lima in December? #QandA @QandA
Robb: "...the department has a set of rules..." --- so change them, foolish man... #qanda
#QandA no wonder our country continues to sink further in debt.  Pollies (Burke) don't understand stimulus. Andrews Gov't fail fail fail

Way to make me turn #qanda off and do something more constructive... Allow such a toxic question to be asked...

#qanda Australians with any common sense have lost this country to the conservatives.
Gender stereotyping can hurt. Males who are taught that they must be a "hard man" is bad. "Be a man and have emotions" #qanda @QandA
I was depressed last time Robb was in Government and more depressed now that he's back there #qanda
The state of the world should depress me, but I'm optimistic that it isn't a lost cause yet. #qanda
Hard to have social cohesion with Hinch on the panel. #QandA
#qanda community= unity for both the good and the bad... We are one and we are many!
#qanda I wish we could fund de-radicalisation of Aussie jingoism.
is he talking about the Bolte? (another toll road that was supposed to SOLVE congestion?) #qanda
That kid for PM #QandA
#QandA is anyone going to ask Robb about the secret trade agreement he doesn't want to tell us about?
Bureaucratic back scratching cost millions #qanda
Top show on @QandA tonight!
The association between alcohol and sport needs to stop. #qanda
Like watching a snail crawl up a window.  #QandA
#qanda The roads of 21st century should be RAILROADS! Peak Oil is coming, Tony Abbott!
Public Transport what's that #CentralWest #outback #QandA bring trains outwest, update roads.
So much respect for the panellists on #QandA telling their stories of depression. #ujcomm2657
aweneed to get rid of all religion #qanda
We talk about the importance issue of mental while at the time great programs like KidsMatter is at threat of being de-funded! Crazy! #QandA
At least Abbott wasn't drunk in question time again #QandA
Great question! @QandA
What would Derryn know about the legal system? Oh wait... #qanda
Interesting fact: Skoll means cheers in Danish #qanda
Like it or not ISIS claim they are fighting in the name of Islam. If moderate Muslims don't want that association, then say so #QandA
Why must we "tolerate" Muslims who refuse to even accept the rights of non-Muslims to live? #qanda
I don't particularly care if footballers want to get drunk. It's the whole rape thing they need to deal with #qanda
just flicked back to #qanda and WHOA SLOW DOWN MODS LET'S NOT PUT AWFUL PARODY ACCOUNTS THROUGH TO THE SCREEN http://t.co/waiJ07QiUh
Well done @DHughesy. Loved your input tonight.  #QandA
What? No #tpp question? #qanda
Martin Place was NOT A TERRORIST EVENT! Only politicians say so. #qanda
The infrastructure size is too big.. London tube-sized trains should be the model #qanda
Derryn, you have ten minutes before I drag myself off to bed by my eyeballs. #qanda
It is time to get off this Melbourne-centric discussion, what does it have to do with Western Sydney? #qanda
@QandA Reverse Engineering? #qanda
After sculling schooies at the pub, Tony goes to the footy with his mates Parrot and Richo #qanda http://t.co/C6qqdayFTd
Qanda did anyone ask whether the citizens wanted that nightmare
The infrastructure PM is proving to be less about infrastructure and more about roads #qanda
I tried to commit suicide a few times. In going much better now though.  #QandA
#qanda Unfortunately every ethnic in Australia has to now prove they are not Islamic
#qanda This country is a mean, nasty toilet.

We are all mined for someone else's use. #qanda
"If you need immediate help call triple 0." This is an important number people forget. #qanda
Really glad I didn't switch off after ten minutes #qanda just got interesting
This show knows how to trivialize serious topics, a snap shot of modern life #qanda
Big bloody #qanda sign promoting #qanda on the #qanda set. What is #mediawatch doing about this outrage?
I'm watching #qanda and I keep accidently calling 'shame' and 'hear hearing' statments... I am SO ready for YP 2015.. #YMCAYPSA
Howmany verbal attacks have there been against Muslim going about their business on public transport #qanda
If the Vic Liberal party didn't sign the East-west contract, adequate funding would be available. #QandA
#qanda audience is hella turnt
Go Anna Burke! @QandA #QandA
*TEAM ANNA BURKE* #qanda
My question is this; I am pretty racist. #qanda
Almost 25% of young people have mental health issues, yet only 5% of the health budget is focussed on tackling mental illness. #QandA
Those kids weren't a genuine threat or they wouldn't have been let out on bail. They were Right Wing clickbait and pollbait #qanda
@annabelcrabb + @AndrewRobbMP on #kitchencabinet is well worth a watch if you're enjoying the inspiring chat re mental health on #qanda
Let's see some hotline numbers up on screen #ujcomm2657 #qanda
#qanda @QandA should ppl &amp; govt keep walking the street asking muslims if they r disenchanted? y should anyone? y muslims feel disenchanted?
Dutton was discretion - but not compassion #qanda
If I was Tony Abbott, I'd be drinking too #qanda
What about a bridge to Tasmania? #qanda
We are racist and yes, I will tell you we are #QandA
Relying on booze to have a good time is problematic. It's important to take a break. #qanda
Our campaign is targeting #mentalhealth in communities off the beaten track, another are that needs to be helped #qanda
#qanda @qanda @DHughesy &amp; @HumanHeadline the 2 DH's together , OMG #livingthedream
#qanda recessions are good for getting cars off the road
This is something that needs to be discussed. @QandA
The system in Australia has failed myself and so many others #qanda
Interesting choice of first question... #qanda
Looking forward to Anna Burke on #qanda but oh @DHughesy you are so right we are all the same! #humans
#qanda litmus test 
#qanda it's not all about you Derryn!
I have to say, the support offered by the Northern Territory Government, Public Sector for mental health should be applauded. #qanda
They usually give us some chill questions before throwing in a happy little racist. #qanda
Everything that is fucked about Australia is reflected in the current #qanda debate
#qanda West Gate Bridge is a daily disaster. Public transport is not the solution
Here we go weirdo on #qanda yelling out about nothing
#qanda If she's been here 8 years and her son is 8 or 9, surely you'd be requiring her to be psychic?

Great topics on @QandA tonight! #Labour MP Anna Burke is especially #entertaining
Anna Burke "it's everyone else's fault" for the ANZAC Day terrorist plot #qanda
Choosing a #vegan diet is comparable to islamic extremism? Shame Anna Burke! #qanda
@QandA what about the sovereign risk caused by the government reneging on the RET?
Bloody social media. #qanda
#qanda East west connection, what is it?
Why wait? You've had 5 months....Mr Robb  #qanda
Are you going to ask Andrew Robb anything about his bloody portfolio ? #QandA #quanda #Hopeless
Doc Brown says it best "Roads. Where we're going, we don't need...Roads" #qanda
@QandA Mr ROBB, please explain what Australia will give away under the TPP #QANDA
Andrew Robb was a minister in  Howard govt.  Speaks volumes. #qanda
I wanna see everyone sneeze when the sun comes up #qanda
Mental illness has huge stigma in some migrant communities, contrbutes to youth disinfranchisment in these communities.  #qanda
Derryn and Dave, this should be good #qanda
Rules are guidelines #qanda
#qanda Thought Abbott believed that winning an election gives you a mandate.
Schools could be frontline against radicalisation if more qualified welfare and social workers were funded (not chaplains) #qanda
This is not my Australia. #QandA http://t.co/7xfvx8prWe
cannabis has always helped me sleep at night! due to sexual abuse by non family member! I wonder how many people self medicate? @QandA
What do you do when the report doesn't say what you want? Get more reports until they do. #qanda
@mektronik @AustralianRonin @3d1kZen - aargh - the culture wars are still going......#TPP Robb is slipping away into the night. #qanda
When I think of #qanda I think of Animal Farm.
#qanda We don't want the link, we want public transport
@QandA turn Manly Hospital into a mental health facility instead of selling it off
Hi again. We're back for #qanda. :) moar asio powers plz cuz terrorism
Look don't wanna be snarky but should an all-white panel be commenting on Islamophobia/the experiences of young Muslim Australians? #qanda
More action, less talk, that might be a good way to go guys... #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Signing trade agreements with Investor State Dispute Settlement (#ISDS) mechanisms = treason #qanda #auspol #tpp http://t.co/9YU1EOPOWo

#QandA birds are go!!!
#qanda too much talk and No action!
SHORTER HINCH: "...drive your cars, bitches..." #qanda
Public Transports great but it can't get you everywhere and we'll always need road networks #qanda
It's a stupid plan. #qanda
#QandA Aw - don't obey law - Int'l or Australian - just change it to suit your own needs.
Drinking is not a culture. It can be a disease #qanda
@QandA We still don't want the bloody thing built. Put the money into mental health funding! #qanda
#qanda any discussion of the PM being fit and setting a good example for kids...not on the ABC
Sad times when threat of court time and/or jail time is one of the main ways to finally get much needed support for mental health. #qanda
Times have moved on. Smoking no longer okay. Glorifying alcohol no longer okay #QandA
Better the 'greenies' forcing people onto public transport before the laws of physics do. #QandA
#qanda @qanda why arent there any Muslims on the panel?
Islamaphobia is a vote winner #qanda
It's 2015, can we get over religion already? #qanda
Is it just me or is there more gunfire in the #QandA studio tonight than usual?
Hinch on #qanda = jumping the shark.
No the gubmint will not take responsibility for whipping up terrirism hysteria, nor will it stop #qanda
I was driven to drink by the Liberal Party #qanda
@QandA clearly both! #qanda
#QandA So lets stop segregating remote communities?
#qanda @JohnTheLeftist @antigreenharris I currently have an erection
Andrew Robb is as convincing a footballer as he is a Trade Minister. #QandA
No Robb it is our problem not just Muslim people's #qanda
She said there is a seven hundred page report that should have a blueprint #qanda
I don't believe people who say they don't like drinking #qanda @QandA
Australia's drinking problem costs how much? #qanda Wow. Toughest man in the pub doesn't drink. So true!!
Well said, Ethan! #qanda
@QandA Congestion isn't eased by more roads. Improvement of public transport is the solution. #qanda
@shoreytime @sussanley @QandA and it shouldn't matter where they're from, it's basic human rights which are not being met
Build the roads of the twenty first century,.,. Remember!?, #qanda
Tomorrow morning Derryn will wake up to death threats @QandA
@divydogs also it's hard to remember when you go to #qanda that it's not acceptable to yell at the panel IRL - only ok at home
My pet peeve about returning to Aus after living in London is Melb roads and transport. And Tony Abbott. #qanda
@QandA best panel and conversation tonight #qualitytv #qanda
Lipo test? where can I do it? @QandA #qanda
@janeburns on #qanda : 7 people a day attempt suicide in Australia. #NMHCReport has solutions for #mentalhealth
Great question from Ethan for Tyrone. I hope they get ANSWERS. #QandA
The hilarious part is they will kick out a kid that has autism, but they let one be the leader of the coalition #qanda
Bless @AndrewRobbMP for continuing to tell his story. A story of many. #qanda
Hughesy called it. #qanda
It takes a 10 year old boy to ask a question we all want answered. And we still want it answered. #qanda
@DHughesy So Simple. So Right. #qanda
@RitaPanahi @QandA  incontrovertible? is that a real word? if so, what does it mean?
Let's not forget that the LNP does, in fact, send people to be raped, tortured and killed. And does so for a 3 word slogan. #qanda
#qanda I'm more worried about the PM's view on asylum seekers than I am about his drinking performances
Brave discussion #QandA
We just had a referendum on the #EWlink, and voted against it. Get over it! No new train lines built in Melbourne since 1932! #qanda
Please see a psychologist or psychiatrist if you're worried about having depression. Professionals, not life coaches #qanda
Reverse engineering? #qanda
The Iraq war was the greatest govt waste of money on record. Thanks, John Howard! #QandA #auspol
#qanda could use some diversity on the panel tonight Tony
The unis are not graduating enough psychologists and especially psychiatrists. @QandA #QandA
Build a bridge &amp; Get over it  #QandA
Ugh who invited the liberal humanist? #qanda
Let's fund mental health not cut it #qanda
Hinch is pissed off already #qanda
Having been to jail doesn't make u a legal or bail expert @HumanHeadline. Being a legally qualified judge or magistrate does, though. #qanda
Can't blame social media for Islamophobia when it's blatant in mainstream media also #qanda
Where does this member of an ethnic minority get off asking a question not  related to his ethnicity? Doesn't he know how #qanda works?
To be against murder of sentient beings extreme? #QandA
Liberals - they just don't like paying for other people's treatment #qanda
In case anybody missed it Andrew Robb has secured 3 free trade agreements &amp; didn't even get a bloody thankyou on #QandA ;) Beware Australia
Public transport .. Disappointing and annoying people since 2000 #qanda @QandA
Living in Canberra is definitely conducive to depression #qanda
The difference is Bob Hawke wasn't the Prime Minister when he did it #QandA
#qanda Abbott is probably still playing to his swinging voter W suburbs supporters... you bet he is!
How odd that the only people who participate in Islamic terrorism are those who adhere to ... Islam! #qanda
#qanda will Tony ever stop talking over panellists trying to state their position? Let them speak, that's why you've got them there.
Are you feeling thirsty? #QandA
@AndrewRobbMP "shhhh no one mention the #TPP" #qanda
They are brainwashed into their religion #qanda
Good point by Anna Burke on suicide stats needing to be talked about like road tolls but we can't use word 'succeed' @DartCenter #QandA
@DHughesy is equal parts witty and humourous, and equal parts insightful and inspiring #QandA
Tony Abbott is NO Bob Hawke. #qanda
Okafor or Towns? #QandA
Robb begins/continues the Muslim baiting on #QandA
Let's face it. It's the minority of immigrants and 1st Generation Australians that assimilate and integrate. The majority do NOT #QandA
What?! #qanda http://t.co/hOlyL0ERbG
@LaLegale @QandA Again, if we treat 'chemical imbalances' with chemicals what is the neurology of it.
Deporting a 10year old for being a burden on the health system. What is this Breaking Bad? #qanda
@TonyAbbottMHR wants the health budget to pay for itself. Why doesn't he take the same attitude to the defence budget? #qanda
If you have diabetes, you take drugs to help regulate your body's chemicals. Same applies for illness like depression. #qanda
#qanda train drivers still need to drive to work...unless they have a company vehicle?
#QandA Hitler was one terrorist. Has any body blamed Christianity? Why islam is always accused, not individuals?
#qanda we need to find an alternate remedy to mental illness. SSRI's are a bandaid and are detrimental to our health.
Derren..if we start correlating IS with Islam then all bets are off with christianity and any other identifier that you approve of. #qanda
Hinch trying to rewrite history on his drinking. #qanda
The Japanese have the best infrastructure in the world. And that's despite fucking earthquakes taking it down constantly. #qanda
Preventative mental health care, it IS a priority. #QandA
Thanks for the plug for #HelloSundayMorning  @janeburns #qanda
When will this East-West Link debate end if it keeps cycling with the change of state govt? How can wasted money like this stop? #qanda
So vegans are extreme because they don't want animals to be killed? Anna Burke. #qanda
The voters in Victoria voted Labor in so the link was not built. #qanda
But who will we fear when Islam is revealed not as the enemy? #qanda
@scschwer I am not depressed. I am a man who has an interest in the subject of rational suicide. #QandA
#QandA @QandA This swinging voter is impressed with @AndrewRobbMP. Despise your party's policies, but applaud you tonight
MONORAIL. MONORAIL. #qanda
Great sanctimonious opinion from the panel #qanda
we are all very separate also #qanda
If they've been bailed doesn't that say three of the men arrested in these 'terror raids' don't pose a threat? #QandA
Whoops. Don't call it an industry! It's a sector! #QandA
Tony Abbott was accused of being soft when he drank responsibly, and he's accused of being reckless by skolling a beer. No win #qanda
It takes a lot longer without high up contacts to find or afford help for mental health issues #qanda
#qanda #auspoI
@maddydell @AyaReina it was incisive. Note: I did not see #qanda
Maybe Tony just wanted lots of beer to down his onions with, what's the big deal? @qanda #qanda

Rowdy bunch in Melbourne tonight, anger over free trade deal with China #qanda #xenophobia
Of course Hawke smashed that beer at the cricket in 9 seconds last year. But he is older than Abbott #qanda

what's a boon doggle? #qanda such jargon
Why do trains come every min in #Beijing but not in #Sydney? Maybe cause Beijing's population is the same as the whole of Australia's #QandA
#qanda shut up Derryn!
John Lennon said it best #qanda #imagine
LNP on the NBN: "A waste of money, let's forget what we've already spent and move on." On the East/West link: "We already paid some!" #QandA
Welcome to #qanda, please check your fedoras at the door. thank you.
#SmashTheStigma #qanda Robb this is a great list of coping mechanisms! Well done for talking.
Love that #qanda 's focus is mental health. Many people feel alone battling mental illness and to hear others feel the same is comforting.
Maybe our PM would like to come on #qanda and discuss excess drinking?
Let's just nuke Iran #qanda
No chaplains in schools, psychologists instead @QandA #qanda
Hinch clearly still hasn't got over being jailed #qanda
#qanda politicians and media are just as responsible as any extremists!
On @QandA tonight, Andrew Robb Trades Minister? Check. Public need for TPP discussion? Check. Pressing issue? Check. Avoidance? Check.
#QandA thats a horrible statistic. Hopefully suicide will be a thing of the past soon
Just want to make it clear that depression does not always result in suicide. #qanda
The audience is quite rowdy tonight #qanda @qanda
Good to see the @LifelineAust &amp; @beyondblue plugs with the Mental Health Questions on #QandA
ALL OF MELBOURNE'S TRAFFIC IS ANGRY AND RUBBISH!! DEAL WITH IT! #qanda Trams are good tho...
Where's @SamHarrisOrg when you need him #qanda
#qanda Goodonya Mr Robb for speaking out about depression
Should Politicians have a drink out laws? oh, wait!  #QandA
Andrew Robb: Being PM is an "honoured position". Shame the LNP didn't afford Gillard the same respect #qanda
Sorry I can't join you tonight #qanda ... I gotta Wait-Awhile .. 2 hours to be exact *sigh*
The Andrews government? You have got to be kidding. That was the previous Treasurer's ticking timebomb #QandA
I agree Mr Robb. Lets start with Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser... #QandA
Amazing how Gov Ministers are prepared to talk about "operational matters" when it comes to Terrorism. #qanda
Looks like #qanda is going to treat #TPP the same way they treat #WikiLeaks - one quick question and then SORRY WE ARE OUT OF TIME! #FFS
We pride ourself on being multicultural so long as you are of European descent #qanda @QandA
Hughsey doesn't drink #qanda
Damn good show, so balanced. Also hardly any dopey or feeble minded tweeters banging on about the leftie ABC. #qanda
@QandA its called the photic sneeze reflex.
I feel for all the Muslims trying to lead a normal life in the midst of this tension #qanda
Ice has to be the worst thing to hit Australia in a very, very long time. #qanda
Suicide is preventable. Law makers need to recognise that. #qanda @QandA
All religions are irrational and therefore extreme. #qanda
Suicide is an epidemic Anna? Didn't realise depression was contagious@qanda #qanda

If people want to support anything that harms their home country then they should leave! @QandA

Well said Ethan #qanda
its a two way street, Australians accept and have for years #qanda
#qanda sad to see Robb dithering instead of asking for action
We're making our lives hell #qanda
#qanda #nature #sunset #travel
Honest mistake from @QandA as it was a highly plausible comment from the real @RitaPanahi. Laughable suggesting it was vindictive. #qanda
Australia has a huge drink problem. We should own it. #qanda
99% of Turkey is Muslim. Yes, that welcoming, generous country who embrace Australia (their invader) every April. #qanda
#qanda Hughesie the road to recovery from depression starts with talking about it
Schools cannot be used to cure the ills of our society. #QandA
Discussion and open mindedness towards mental health is the key #qanda
Reclaim community  #qanda
Ethan! You rock. Compassionate young man  #QandA
@AndrewRobbMP utmost respect for your honest answer about your battle with depression. #qanda
I drink because everyone else is too tough. #qanda
Good to hear people talking about Australia's biggest drug problem, even if not in parliament #qanda
Darren Hinch is one bold man calling things as he feels not afraid of critics. May be rare but surely a man any open society needs. #QandA
Brilliant question! Andrew Robb opening up about depression, needs to happen more. Thanks #qanda
People with very limited perspective and understanding of the world. #qanda http://t.co/z18zqmx78H
We can get through it together! #qanda
Andrew Robb def not rocking the house tonight. #justsaying #qanda
@QandA props to @DHughesy  we're the same, not separate #QandA
more roads means more cars means more traffic! Please! Get the cars off the road. #qanda
#qanda now Derryn thinks magistrates are too soft? Maybe he should have done some more hard time....
#QandA your panel tonight blew harder than a desperate Kardashian. You owe me a Pyne, Xenophon, Bishop, Latham and Ludlam showdown. Stat.
#QandA I told my workplace about my depression...  it was their excuse to sack me!!!
Marginalization is the problem #qanda
#qanda I'm a community mental health nurse that despairs at the chronic lack of support &amp;resources we are expected to operate with
#QandA a good starting point would be to stop over indulging and focus on the needs of others
"You might think you're special... you're not" - @DHughesy bringing some welcomed humour to the #QandA panel
#qanda Prevention and early detection is what is needed.
Hearing audience members just yelling shit relentlessly at the panel... Proud to be a Melbournian lol #QandA
You know PC has gone through the roof when people say skolling a beer is "irresponsible" #qanda
We need a focus on prevention and promotion of wellbeing  #NMHCReport #mentalhealth #qanda
@QandA #qanda tolerance and acceptance needs to be modeled by all
Heartbreaking. Photos of boat carrying 300 refugees that's just sunk in Greek waters. At least 20 feared dead #qanda http://t.co/R15l89RjGG
It would be good to have a panel that is more religiously diverse when these topics are being discussed #qanda
#qanda Drugs are a major problem, and lead to causing many other problems that plague our society.

I don't watch #qanda because I know I'd just shout at the telly. I don't know why I look at Twitter while #qanda is on. *shakes stick*
Brave comments!  #qanda
What a legend, @AndrewRobbMP , to speak so candidly about an issue as intensely personal as mental health. #qanda
Employers look for behaviour like that on peoples social media profiles. How did he get the job? #qanda
@QandA nothing gets us more fired up than debating about a road that should've been built a long time ago #qanda
#qanda Why do you never have medical professionals on the panel when discussing medical issues?!
Medication can help treat mental illness, but it also takes hard work, support and motivation to do so #qanda
#QandA @QandA Depression needs TREATMENT. Psychologists have TRAINING. Government Review proves the need to increase "BETTER ACCESS"!
wouldn't the problem cancel it's self out? He's a "burden" to the heath system, yet she is helping the health system...Let them stay! #qanda
#QandA it is am illness that needs expert medication before psychoanalysis is effective fund the psychiatrists
The previous state government was criminal to try and commit Victoria to such massive spending, it should be them that are paying #qanda
@QandA  TMS   treatment for depression ,not  available easily ,This needs to be addressed
Perhaps depression is a perfectly reasonable response to the capitalist, materialist society in which we live #qanda
If only he was a burden on our terrorism laws he would probably be allowed to stay then @QandA
...and of course pretending #climatechange doesn't exist helps too #qanda

Melbourne traffic - I think I am slipping into a coma ! #qanda @mektronik
Anna Burke compare Islamic radicals to vegan radicals. Really? This is the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought! #qanda
You can help by not asking for litmus tests #qanda
Seriously, alcohol companies being major sponsors for sport are sending out mixed messages! Not appropriate! #QandA
Q&amp;A really should have spent more time on mental health. That was an interesting and important conversation now cut short #qanda
@qanda The sector is united but the government has it's own agenda
#qanda @QandA can anyone ask Anna Burke if Melbourne can survive 50 yrs without EW link? she is more stupid than i thought.
Anyone else having trouble with Android @abciview app? Can't watch #qanda :(
#QandA  The LNP signed off the contract knowing it was not going to happen
@QandA @AndrewRobbMP Well said Minister Robb. The Imams do have to show leadership within their communities.
Can we mute Hinch's microphone please? #QandA
@RitaPanahi @QandA would love to see you on that show giving it to the left
You may ask, how did I manage to skoll the beer so quickly? Easy; I imagined it was a delicious fresh onion #qanda #lizardking
And they say the youth of today is self centred and disrespectful #qanda
If only robb had the same view of the #tpp as #NMHCReport #QandA #morethinkinglessdoing
Tony has a habit if putting off altogether those 'we're coming to that later' questions. #qanda
There's a real man, not one skolling a beer #qanda
Abbott said the election would be a referendum on the East West Link #qanda
I'm sure these are all very important issues, however the people discussing them are SO annoying I cannot cope #qanda
My one word anti-terrorism policy: JOBS #QandA
2000 submissions contributed to solutions that can be acted upon now #NMHCReport #mentalhealth #qanda @janeburns
Inch back in Shock Jock mode #qanda
Abbott skolling beer and eating raw onions shows how worryingly open to suggestion our PM is. #qanda
We need to work on reversing our culture of merely reacting, and start trying to prevent. #qanda
Meanwhile on #QandA Audience member gets Pwnd by Anna Burke
#qanda the infrastructure PM should spend on infrastructure that will benefit Australia in the long run
Some people are funnier than others, hey Hughsey? #QandA
No one has asked the question about what causes depression in our society? #QandA @QandA
Let's talk about excessive alcohol advertising, rather than someone of note being seen having a drink. #qanda
#QandA the PM is role model &amp; leader, would it be ok if he smoked a joint
Downing a beer in one has never made me a better electrician and I'm 100% sure it won't make Abbott a better PM. #qanda
"Poop fart" - Anna Burke #qanda
It may not resolve it but it sure as hell will help it #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Ageing baby boomers could see a depression epidemic in the future #qanda
Why is this even an issue ? There are bigger things happening in the world @QandA #qanda
Ah Anna Bligh, speaking sense. It'll never catch on! #qanda
@kelsojado yep better watch out or indigenous Australians may reclaim it #qanda
Anna Bourke on #QandA - lets not say Vegans are the same as terrorist extremists please!
i think the difference is people like bob hawke #qanda
@QandA come along to @MelbRecital tomorrow to hear @MusicaVivaAU @goldnerquartet concert! Ok that's enough plugging now :)
Can Anna Burke eject that audience member under 94a? #qanda
Refreshing to hear a politician speaking so personally about their experience with mental illness #ujcomm2657 #qanda
I can not see the mental health system improving. Too many vested interests and agendas blocking true reform #qanda
#QandA I love going to Victoria it's so 1950's &amp; after ALP for 3 yrs will be 1850's..
CFMEU *drink* #qanda

Very ill people are discharged too early from psych wards! #qanda
So drinking too much makes you like Derryn while not drinking enough makes you like Hughes #qanda
It should be compulsory for schools to teach resilience @QandA #qanda
Love Hughesy! :) #qanda
Extremism? Noooooo! #qanda
So is the #qanda live stream not working? Or is it just me?
Problem with ice is it feels really really really good. #qanda
Robb &amp; Hinch blame others...the rest say it's our responsibility to accept. We are the ones that need to change.  #QandA
Good question kid #QandA
I live in inner north, every morning, I see hundreds of cars with one person in it, this way of commuting is unsustainable #qanda
TPP @QandA #QANDA
#qanda @QandA Is Robb kidding? His TPP is a bigger threat to Australia than terrorists.
#qanda We R not invading Turkey !! We R invading M/EAST !!  That's simply why !!
as always, if you're a right-winger with no basis for your argument, whine about unions #qanda
How bout Anna Burke tonight?! Firing on all cylinders! #qanda
#mentalillness is NOT a lifestyle choice! It's an illness. #qanda
@hayleyelg watched an ep before QandA
@QandA And DON'T mention climate change.
A problem shared is a problem halved @QandA #QandA
Robb should have kept quiet.  #qanda
Tony Abbott IS NOT Bob Hawke. #QandA #AusPol
Sorry, but Andrew Robb is just another politician #qanda
You know you're Australian when you understand and agree with Dave Hughes. "We're all the same# #ujcomm2657 #qanda
#QandA Mental health stigma will always remain while we remain identified with our minds. Mindfulness NEEDS to be championed.
So many incredibly intelligent and creative people throughout history have suffered a mental illness #qanda
The Photic Sneeze Effect aka Autosomal-dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst (ACHOO) syndrome #qanda
Andrew Robb .... You are a vile example of everything bad about the LNP.. #qanda
#QandA @QandA 50 sessions for psychiatrists, only 10 for psychologists. Psychologists are cheaper - let the client CHOOSE their treatment!
I wonder how Robb feels about his party's bad health policies, considering he depends upon those services to manage his depression #qanda
Can we get a headspace in Nauru and Christmas Island? #qanda @QandA #ujcomm2657
It's going to be a long night for Hughesy. #qanda
#qanda Thank You Panel. ..... Ban Live Export. END Whaling. LAWS. ~AB O&amp;O
I think we should all watch what we say about Islam, am doing my part telling #Muslims terrorists to go &amp; get well &amp; truly fucked! #qanda
This questioner has his STATS #qanda
#qanda Dear Leftards, the PM drank a beer. Get over it.
There needs to be more funding. Especially for CAT teams. #qanda
Road lobby there's your answer #qanda
What does it mean to be Australian in 2015 #qanda let's air the issues without fear. Aussies care about each other in communities. Fact.
@pollyhistoric YOU DON'T KNOW ME, something about #qanda, picture of cat. Like I said, you are made for twitter
No, didn't think so..  #QandA
Thanks for discussing medication. It's a HEALTH issue #qanda
I look forward to watching my twitter feed tonight with this panel! #Qanda
@h_e_l_e_n_j Are you there this time? #qanda ;)
AHHH the Monday blues wash away under the glare of #qanda on the TV screen.
This fake Rita Panahi account is going to wind up with a defo suit #QandA
When I was depressed I I called Tony Abbott.  We went out for a drink and I was better #qanda
wow, subtle liberal plant is subtle #qanda
#qanda Christian crime is the same as Muslim crime.
#Qanda @Qanda yeah we love diversity as long as it is compatible with our culture
Great shout out to the @AFLPlayers and @AFL on #qanda in displaying leadership on depression and mental illness
The prime minister should not be downing beers in 6 minutes in pubs. Especially when his Government brought out the new alcohol rules #qanda
#QandA Is this for real??? If so, get it changed, and get it changed right now! I'm looking at you Andrew Robb.
#Qanda
#QandA need more funding for psychologists, more Medicare appointments!!
These guys should need to take a litmus test for tolerance #qanda http://t.co/Hp6v3PUXB9
David Hughes is so right. We are all humans #qanda
#imagen #qanda still on TV today?
Did he just say Shaykh Ukelele. #qanda
Let's face it EW Link would've provided a nice smooth road for the Lib residents of the eastern suburbs #qanda
I also sneeze when I look at the sun #qanda
@mediawatcher83 not sure they voted for Swanston St. To be ripped up.. just DIDNT vote for the EW Link #qanda
Funny that we have a national campaign about ice addiction, but can't scrape together the funding for a domestic violence campaign. #qanda
Turn on #qanda and I hear Dave Hughes. Seriously why? What could he possibly add to the panel... Besides mumbling!?
#qanda Anna Burke still the same stupid cow as always, God I hate Labor.
Fucking hell. The answer is ALWAYS to say Labor did it first. No matter how petty the issue. #qanda
FFS. Skolling a beer is about the most Aussie thing you can do #qanda
Wow - how rude was that woman #QandA
'It's extremism we need to knock out. Not one religion over another.' Amen Anna Burke! #qanda

@QandA who are the real terrorists causing fear in the world: USA or ISIL? #Iraq #Afghanistan #WMD #QandA
I've seen robynkelly67 get on the screen many times. Must be an ABC worker again. Lol #QandA
The mainstream media doesn't want to report on moderates, for extremists sell more papers. #QandA
Alcohol is a long term part of nearly every culture #QandA
Sharing personal stories about mental health is the only way to stop the stigma. #qanda @AndrewRobbMP
Terror raids?  Mixed up teenagers. Not men. Agree?  #QandA
You don't 'commit' suicide. Taking your life is not a crime. #QandA
Depression in men can manifest as anger management or hypochondria. #qanda
Jesus, she's worse than the Ford ad chick! #qanda
fake Rita Panahi tweet made it on screen. Well done #qanda @RitaPanahi
Ethan - the most eloquent question of the night #qanda #bravo
@HumanHeadline have a good show @QandA #qanda
#qanda Derryn selling the law according to Derryn again
Turkey largely secular due to Attaturk. #fail #qanda
Call the rules for what they are: discriminatory, disgusting and disturbing. #qanda
Hey @AndrewRobbMP, if the #TPP is so good for Australia, why silence dissent? When will you #ReleaseTheText? #WhySoSecret #qanda #auspol
@QandA  when ur depressed and asking for help is hard but after it you feel good
@QandA Hinch shows once again that he has no understanding of the legal system. #qanda
@QandA Nice to see @HumanHeadline &amp; @DHughesy together.....:)
Tony Abbott is supporting the torture of small children. Talk about that not about him drinking a beer. Jesus. #qanda
Finally a decent question! #qanda
Great to hear children speak up #qanda
Are the budget cuts to blame for the mics tonight? #qanda
#qanda islamophobia is not real
We need to look after each other. Put down your mobile phone and spend time with your family &amp; friends. #QandA
They've been released because that's the law Hinch. Obviously you don't understand it.  #QandA
#qanda Islam is a death cult
Many comedians are depressives #qanda
We can deradicalise them. We have the technology #qanda

Same old problem with this Govt. Cannot manage to get on and DO anything. #auspol #qanda #mentalhealth
Good on you, buddy #qanda
Medicare access to psychologists should be expanded back to 16 sessions a year, #qanda
@queen_elizabet @QandA good lord you r kidding me!!
Anna Burke- everything that you're saying tonight is so perfect. Why do some people just not get it?? #QandA #ujcomm2657
Robbo to down one tonight #qanda
#qanda yup fix public transport , encourage push bikes (good for mental health) and don't let local councils rip up rail lines ! #Newcastle
Hughesey, me old double helix: we DON'T all have the same DNA. #QandA
#QandA Polling showed 62% of Victorians wanted the East-West tunnel built!

Oh great, the Lib Small Biz guy ragging on a BAD road deal. #qanda
Not having the stigma attached to mental health helps... alot. ADF has a huge stigma problem, from recruitment to continuing service #qanda
Abbott had the beer with a raw onion chaser. #qanda
@QandA @DHughesy good for you David Hughes!
#QandA the problem comes down to which issues will win votes.
Derryn, the stigma needs to be broken! #qanda
Derryn knows the legal system quite well #qanda
Here's our best tweeting advice #auspol: Tweet often. Be on topic. Keep it short. Keep it clean. Always use the hashtag #QandA
Suicide is never the answer . #qanda @QandA
Just NUKE the middle east and be done with the whole terrorist thing.  It worked in Hiroshima... #QandA #AusPol
The biggest bigot in the country is the prime minister so that doesn't help  #qanda
They do, they will continue to be so, so what #QandA
my question for the #qanda audience: is this not the sickest dinobeat https://t.co/XnGf4KoQnv
The government needs to see public transport is the future #qanda
That was the 1970s. Let's move on. #qanda
Stigma definitely still there. But disability caused by moderate depression is similar to disability from relapsing MS. #qanda
Why do people say 'the fact is....' It just makes me skeptical of what will be said next #qanda
Alcohol needs to be a choice in the Australian social scene, not an expectation #qanda
Andrew Nobb should be awesome on this question #qanda
Glad the TPP is getting the scrutiny it deserves... #qanda
@OpKrismarg @LaLegale: Depression:AWilderness Experience @qanda #qanda #auspol  https://t.co/LgSbkiSajj
At last a positive comment on building our country not always tearing it down #qanda

Silly me. I though reclaim Australia was a movement for indigenous rights. #qanda
#qanda Shellharbour Hospital recently losts its mental health beds n department
The exact nature of the alleged attack that was thwarted would inform this discussion #QandA
#QandA great question from the kid!
The fear of the known  #QandA
Andrew Robb was lucky enough to have a great support system. We need to build a society where more people have that support #qanda
#qanda Yes, and all Australians are paying $8 billion to keep several thousand innocent people in Manus &amp; Nauru!!
@QandA #QandA #NoTTIP #NoTPP #TPP #TIPP STOP THE SECRECY AND THE MADNESS NOW!
Qanda mental health issues need to be treated as health problems not criminal issues
@matwhi omg I started in but switched to #qanda  should i just switch back
#QandA Anna Burke as a former speaker how would you rate the performance of the current speaker #biased ?
If @qanda said it it must be true. I mean, if it wasn't that would be aggravated damages right @RitaPanahi ? #auspol
#qanda NEXT! This is a Melbourne issue with a national audience
Need to remember Australia is a big and diverse country. Our #mentalhealth system must support everyone who needs it #qanda
Cultural diversity is what makes our country great. We need to support and respect #QandA
Wanna learn about expensive tunnels no one can afford to go through...come to Queensland!!! #QandA #QldPol
#QandA One of our biggest crises is the disproportionate numbers of Aboriginal youth taking their own lives!
My followers who still watch #qanda have more patience than I do... Take a bow
Why is it Ok to be physically unwell but mentally unwell brings a stigma?  #qanda
Your govt is playing on that fear too. Your govt hasn't helped at all.  #qanda
@mistergjones tune in to #QandA next week. Your favourite politician @tanya_plibersek is on!
I wish Abbott would take leadership on #DomesticViolence seriously. Two #women dying weekly is the real real #DeathCult. #QandA
They remove themselves from the gene pool.they are providing a service #qanda
Personally, I really like ppl ask me "R U OK?" :) #qanda
Meth is the main cause of mental illness today #QandA
Legislate to have alcohol replaced with water in all beverages. Watch the placebo work miracles #qanda
Our future will be stronger when the weak weed themselves out #qanda
The Martin Place Beheading was a fraud #qanda
Could youth radicalisation be related to narcissism? #qanda
The importance of improving our mental health services- save peoples lives, this is a tragedy! #QandA
Dave Hughes: the tl:dr of the panel tonight. #QandA
#qanda 9/11 was bait. They thought Bush was dumb enough to swallow it. Don't be that dumb.
#qanda Where's the discussion about TPP you lying toe rag, Tony Jones! #wasteofspace
#qanda Are there any women there tonight? Oh, yes one asked a question...
Drumming up the FEAR in #qanda Robb calls Martin Place shooting "Martin Square". Unhunh?
Hughsie the Hippie #qanda
@QandA My son has Autism and he is a burden to nobody.
Why are we more outraged by a few radical Mulsims than systemic child abuse from Christians in this country? @QandA  @CARoyalComm
We should all become  Eathanopians #qanda
The lack of understanding of mental health, even by health professionals, is astounding. #qanda
Nice to end #qanda with question of the night from a top young person beyond #NYW15! @yawcrc
Radicalising is the problem- deradicalising is the solution #QandA
So everyone should be censored except you, eh Derryn ? #qanda
Speaking openly about medication is so so crucial. We as a society are so scared of it, but we mustn't be. It helps. #qanda
"Litmus test" for citizenship sounds a bit too much like the white Australia policy. #qanda
Ice ruins lives. Huge contributor to depression and suicide #qanda
@QandA lost what shred of credibility it had. Minister Robb on panel but no Qs permitted on #TPPA AU now client state of corp USA #qanda
@QandA @AndrewRobbMP They can't fund antiterror program.  They need terrorists to boost Abbotts popularity with the easily scared voters.
Good of #qanda to raise the tone of this debate.
@QandA Tony Abbott PM for the rest of his life!!! Shudder - think of country, not Abbott.
Also, can we get build a railway to the airport and not pay $100 for a cab there? #qanda
Zing! #qanda
School psychologists! Preventative measures are best #qanda
@qanda Hinch just hijacked convo onto ice
Great that you had a great relationship to be able to chat to your mum @DHughesy. #qanda
Social inclusion is fostered through political leadership, as well as community leadership #QandA
@LaLegale @JaneCaro @QandA @MotherofOpinion plenty of Children need parenting
It was just a drink... Most of us have had one or more. Surely there's better topics we could discuss #qanda
muslims are the victims of the western world bully @QandA  #qanda
#QandA Kudos to you. That is a strong man to publically talk about it.
@QandA imagine the reduction in domestic violence, drug addiction etc if more $ went into prevention #qanda
Just the mention of the Australian immigration department makes me shudder. #qanda
Hey mum #QandA
This seems to be a great injustice. The Government must intervene #QandA
Great answer by Robb. Well done! #qanda
He's a little kid. #qanda
#ReclaimAustralia is about reclaiming bigotry #qanda
Oops @QandA put up a fake @RitaPanahi tweet https://t.co/nlIQrNEYcS seemed a bit over the top but you never know.
#QandA Anna Burke always nails that sweet place of justice.
#qanda Islamophobia was created to suppress criticism of Islamic beliefs.
Victoria voted for public transport, get over it #qanda
Let's hope #qanda doesn't let @AndrewRobbMP the treasonous politician speak too much #treasonousTPP
Someone tell @AndrewRobbMP that 94% of traffic is moving into the city. #EWLink wouldn't help #qanda
It also great to see a humble man telling his story, especially helping with stigma of mental health in MEN that it is okay to admit! #QandA
Suicide can be a rational choice. #QandA
Hughsey has no idea #qanda
Andrew Robb's contribution to this field has been remarkable. His approach is an exemplary case study partic for his younger peers. #qanda
Could have had an Aussie beer instead of a peroni #qanda
So refreshing to hear such honesty from a politician. #QandA
Global problem? So then why is LNP clapping people in gaols for recognising the global problem? #qanda
thanks @janeburns for reminding us that just because you can't see mental health problems sometimes, doesn't meant they don't exist #qanda
Ethan for PM #qanda
Sharia law is about the only law Derryn hasn't been found in contempt of #qanda
@kaneowhite and you love #qanda
If you want to go into alcoholism and Australianism...can you at least ask a proper question? This is going nowhere... #QandA
@qanda Anna not scared at all......we want more Anna's
Are we going to spend any more time discussing this? Please move on. #qanda
@unionsaustralia immigration is a numbers game and only 'healthy' ones make it in. Been there. Its just the way things are #qanda
Well I'm depressed to know some people (yes you Anna Burke) think vegans are dangerous extremists #qanda
Robb is fear mongering as usual! The government needs to lead us in another direction. #QandA
Abbott was flat out like a lizard person drinking. #qanda
I would love to hear what Anna Burke thinks about Bronwyn Bishop and how biased she is. #QandA #auspol
Apparently you have to drink to be a "dinky-di bloke." But you don't have to be "blokey" to be a man. #qanda
Public transport might be more widely used if it were safe #qanda
The LNP rentacrowd is in full voice tonight on #qanda
Abbott calls for an end to binge drinking, but then thinks that skolling a beer will give him credibility? #hypocrite #QandA
The West is unable to have an honest conversation about radical Islam, and the problem of religion in general #qanda
Abbott- The king of the Yobbos #auspol #qanda
This @qanda is all over the place #qanda
We're deporting a mother and her child because the child has severe autism? My oh my. #qanda
Because anyone who willingly eats tofu must be a little bit marginalised. #veganextremism #qanda
#QandA There is only one long term treatment to mental illness, a loving and supportive family. Not more business for doctors and lobbyists.
@DixonJrdc @LaborFAIL Its called the @AustralianLabor party. #qanda
Drinking beer hasn't made him more popular among younger voters. At all. @QandA #qanda
My question is for Derryn: how hot does jet fuel get and can it melt steel beams because I believe jet fuel can't melt steel beams #qanda
How do you turn off tweets on #qanda. What if I dont want to read everbodys opinion?
Misleading use of the term 'moderate leaders' as if extremists were part of a normal spectrum of Muslim leadership. #qanda
One can, and should always look for, something they can be #grateful for. #qanda
After such a great conversation on Mental Health we turn to a local Road issue? #qanda
#QandA we are one and we are many
It's agile local community services that make the difference in preventing #suicide #QandA
How much louder do we need Islamic leaders need to be? They have spoken against terrorism. Maybe ppl are listening enough   #QandA
#qanda ethan for PM
Massive cheers for light rail. Music to the ears. #qanda
Andrew Robb says no knee jerk reactions on MH report. What was Hlth Min Ley's instant veto of transfer of acute care funding? #qanda
#Qanda FSS #CFMEU STOPPED THE LINK.
If you want to know how a lot of people feel about depression or mental illness, ask the crowd chanting "skull skull" at Tony Abbott. #QandA
#qanda go public transport
The original Australians didn't need foreign investment , what's the problem ? #QandA
#QandA can we deport this government for being a burden?
#qanda Build more rail network and not road network
@nicwkelly it took me about 3 minutes to realise that meant q &amp; a. i was trying to figure out what a qanda was. thought it was an aus word.
Don't agree with your politics but admire you for your words tonight. Good luck Andrew Robb #QandA
That's some nice hate speech on screen #qanda
Dave Huges (@DHughesy) on @QandA whyyyyy? #QandA
#qanda chant
100000 migrating to vic every yr, cars will always rule over public transport #QandA
You got that right Ken a Big YAWN #Qanda  why cant they use this forum to talk about issues like #TPP #TPPA  https://t.co/DcG9f7IdSN
Here we go blame the CFMEU - Typical Conservative rear guard action #qanda
Bob just loves a beer #qanda
Government making excuses. Again. They need a pay cut of about $100k. #qanda
#qanda hello drinking is antisocial behaviour is it not.
I find Andrew Robb absolutely compelling as he discusses his mental health #qanda
#qanda @AndrewRobbMP claimed that on his recent trip to Middle East, 5 countries raised the East West Link with him. Do you believe him?
Andrew Robb's bounce back from severe bout of depression in 2009 is immensely inspiring. #qanda
Toughest guy in the pub is the one who is surrounded by the drunks but does not drink himself. @DHughesy #QandA
Oh no. Technical difficulties. This wouldn't happen at Ultimo. #qanda
Medical depression helped me with my cannabis #QandA
You can call @LifelineAust on 13 11 14 anytime. #qanda
Tony Abbott is definitely on "blokey auto-pilot" at the moment. #QandA
Good way to ruin a quality episode #QandA
To build the major road project would have constituted wasteful spending. This was the best of two bad options. #QandA
Robb you grub, they are here. Give them a #fairgo #QandA
We talk lots now about treatments for and stigmatization of #depression sufferers but never about its cause. Ever #qanda
We need to have open &amp; honest conversations about mental health &amp; depression at workplaces &amp; w/friends. It's a HUGE issue. #QandA #auspol
Anna burkes applause just shows the 90% of #qanda audience is labor/greens leftards
Libs don't like public transport for 1 reason only: unions. We are still AAA Robb! #qanda
#qanda @QandA spends so much time talking about PM having one beer. what a waste of time?
Ruckus! There's a ruckus! #QandA
Yeah guys. What about the Turks? #QandA
Good on U Hughsy ! Its as simple as that !!!   #QandA
@QandA School's monitor behaviour, computers in bedrooms don't.@qanda

@TheunAustralia @Fluffula Some of us are slow leaners. #qanda

I am sick of "experts" not addressing the root causes of issues like mental health &amp; terrorism, here lies the solution. #qanda
I'm opposed to the NDIS - and almost all gov. welfare - but this situation sounds stupid. The minister should intervene. #QandA #auspol
Greens are not green at all, they don't support a fuel excise. Useless. #qanda
Robb is a great example of why people - young and old - should feel supported and comfortable enough to tell someone they aren't okay #qanda
This panel is driving me to drink #qanda
Far more people will be and are touched by mental illness than terrorism in this country. Time to reflect that in our policy focus #qanda
@qanda, Question: who'd you hire on the sound desk and do they know how to get rid of the mic crackling? #qanda
If the PM had downed that drink first then it'd be different... but because Hawkey did it 'first' Abbott will always be a follower. #QandA
Why does Tone keep telling the woman to keep it brief #qanda
Business and government both work at isolating us all then comes along social media? #qanda
That is absolutely fucked #qanda
@QandA Tad prudish to knock someone having a drink.
@WorldOfMarkyD People need to wake up - #TPP gives #corps the right to sue sovereigns if our laws impede THEIR profit making #QandA #auspol

#QandA THANK YOU for such an in depth discussion about mental health. So important.
Andrew Robb putting in an unconvincing performance on #qanda tonight. Generally a smart guy. What happened?
Anna balances Hinch's fear mongering #qanda
This rule must be abolished so that this is NEVER used as a reason to even attempt to deport anyone #qanda
Initiates like Mental As are great for raising awareness of mental health. #qanda
Nothing like talking tough against Muslims to boost a conservative govt's flailing polls #QandA
In the 9 years I lived in London I didn't use a car, yet had to as soon as I moved back to Oz. Big need to improve pub transport #qanda

#qanda So do we Christians need to reject the KKK, the extreme Christians?
#Depression doesn't discriminate. It can affect anyone. Admitting one has the 'Black Dog' isn't a sign of weakness. It's being brave #QandA
We can all see that Abbott's dog whistling has both stirred up bogans like #reclaimaustralia &amp; tiny minority of young muslims #qanda
Andrew Robb is amused that community attitudes change over 60 years.  #qanda

#qanda Why have gov't cut back the sessions a depression sufferer can have with a psychologist in one year under a mental health care plan?
Kudos Ethan. #qanda
Daniel Andrews promised there would be no compensation #qanda
When we have to suggest to Australians to have "dry months" then there is a national problem #qanda
Mental illness is often comorbid with alcoholism. Maybe sharia law would cut back on our drinking.  #QandA
Don't forget to ask a mate who looks troubled #RUOK . #QandA @QandA
#qanda had Robb and no question on the TTP. What a waste @qanda
australian is very good at sweeping issues like suicide under the rug - it starts with awareness #qanda
@QandA Why wasn't Tony Abbott there?
@QandA Labor didn't have all the info regarding contracts signed before election and promises. They're trying. #qanda
Unruly #qanda down there in Melbourne
That says more about the lack of TV coverage of quality female sports #qanda https://t.co/5FPowOkBzA
Hinch suggesting binge drinking is new problem &amp; that it never happened in his day? It's always existed, stop acting holier than thou #qanda
That is disgusting! Liberal values go us #qanda

Is there a Muslim on this panel we can ask? #qanda
Odd these recent raids occurred just before ANZAC day and almost arrested were released. A cynic might think it's a media stunt. @QandA
Why should I be tolerant of extremism?? #qanda @QandA
What a fabulous open-hearted discussion #QandA
It doesn't serve the Government's agenda to reduce Islamophobia #qanda

He might be a burden on the health system? I'm more concerned with the health system being a burden for people with illnesses. #qanda
Do you know who should take a litmus test? Racists. Guess what? You just lost, buddy. #qanda
We should be able to discuss the appalling ideas of Islam without threats  #QandA
Props to robb in sharing his experience with mental illness, not easy when you are in the public eye.  #qanda
Fear is a great helper... for the white middle aged men in charge. #qanda
Abbott showed how low he will go, He is THE PM of our country. Not just anyone.  #qanda
Building roads doesn't ease congestion in the long run. It encourages more people to drive cars. Public transport is the answer #qanda
@qanda audience too smart for Robb
To a lot of Australians, you can't have a good time without alcohol. You can't have one without the other. #qanda
#qanda 18 trains this morning at Clayton before barriers opened! Rail needs managing properly too!

Legalise and use the tax funds on mental health! #qanda

You don't deport vulnerable people. When will our country start to realise that? #QandA
Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Hospital beds will save lives #QandA
Shut Up Andrew Robb. You're an idiot. #qanda
how can you separate children and start labelling them at such a young age!?! #qanda
@qanda no surprise here, I agree with dave "mmmmmm, yeah... ah, religions hard"
#qanda Islam has been in Australia since 1860... what about the Afghan cameleers?
Australia is a multicultural society, we are talking a very small minority who are the extremists #qanda

Yes, ice is a bad drug and it's on the rise. BUT alcohol abuse is still more harmful and is having a more detrimental effect @QandA #qanda
So many functioning alcoholics amongst our community! #qanda
*drinking moralizing tweet* #Qanda
I feel the major takeaway from the Tony Abbott beer incident is the spelling of the word 'skol', rather than 'scull' #qanda
Andrrew Robb. It happens isn't an excuse any more, are you going to say the same thing about priests molesting children?  #qanda
We correctly have laws against anti semitism - why don't we have the same laws for Muslims or other minority religions #qanda
#qanda All this yelling and screaming......just who do the audience think they are? Politicians during question time?

Next question to Robb should be whether he supports his governments defunding of mental health services. #qanda
#Consent, cooperation, commitment" new 3 word slogan to describe mental health policy! I like STOP THE ILLNESS better #qanda

Obviously missed screening question #1 QandA
Admitting your weaknesses does not diminish your strengths @QandA
#qanda let's not start stigmatizing those whom anti-depressants work. One can have counseling as well.
@AndrewRobbMP is full of shit. #qanda
Pretty obvious Mr Robb isn't believing what he's saying #QandA
Lets all respect tiny abott for skulling a beer #qanda
I wonder if the tax payers paid for the drink!  #qanda

Alcohol companies have aligned themselves with sports success,  anzac &amp; noble aspects of society tony abbott jumped on the bandwagon #qanda

How about you tell us what's in the TPP, Andrew Robb? #qanda

Hello Sunday Morning is a fantastic group! @HSM_AUS #QandA
Good to hear on #qanda both Anna Burke and Andrew Robb acknowledge there's a need to improve freight transport flow in #MelbsWest
That said, it takes an absurd amount of time to get an appointment to see a counsellor or psych. And that's just distressing. #qanda
Say what you like about Hawke, he quit the grog for the total of his time in parliament. #QandA
Thousands of psychologists study in first year, it dwindles to a handful of registered psychologists - not enough funds for jobs. #qanda

The fact mental health issues are still stigmatised is depressing. #qanda

Sadly, treatment for mental illness is costly - many just can't afford it #QandA
@Neil1808  Principle objective is  governments manipulation of  population keep  in constant state of fear 2 control them. #qanda #auspol
It's why the stigma needs to go, so people don't do it alone. #qanda
You'll find overseas in Europe, people drink for the 'enjoyment' of drinking, not to get hammered like us Aussies. #qanda
The people of Victoria who voted for this government want better public transport. What don't people understand about that? #qanda
#qanda attempted suicides is an epidemic not 2-3 supposed Muslim terrorists!
The Trans-Pacific Partnership #TPP #TPPA is literally a Mickey Mouse Agreement, with corporate welfare for Disney &amp; Hollywood. #qanda

A lot of psyche drugs seem to make mental illness worse and increase the suicide rate. We need an overhaul I believe #qanda
@AndrewRobbMP "It happens." What a hopeless excuse for a Prime Minister. He's supposed to have BETTER judgement than the rest of us! #qanda

#qanda did Dave Hughes stop drinking 20 Hears ago? Sounds like his poor lefty brain is fried
#qanda if Tony Abbott drinking ONE beer is "inappropriate drinking" were all freaking alcoholics. put it in perspective people.
we could so easily put more education about mental illness in the school  curiculum #qanda
#qanda how many ambushes by a biased leftist panel must we endure before we pull funding from this piece of shit program?
On point Anna Burke we need to progress from just 'tolerance' to 'acceptance' #qanda
All of this talk about drinking being bad for me is depressing me. #qanda

Derryn Hinch is occupying the seat usually reserved for comedians, let's see how this plays out. #qanda
We need to replace stigma with support when it comes to dealing with mental ill-health. #qanda
@Qanda Abbott said there aren't enough people wanting to go from one place to another to justify anything bigger than a car #QandA
Andrews and Labor didn't dump the East-West Link. Victorian voters did at the election. It's called democracy you Liberal wankers. #qanda
There is a stigma around mental illness. Talking about our experiences dismantle it. http://t.co/epVwwhBZE8 #qanda
'I have three kids so roads are more important to me than public transport' So selfish. Shouldn't we all be adapting to transport? #qanda
Hot take: Derryn doesn't wanna be a bloke. #qanda
Dave Hughes says everyone is a human. Oddly enough I've never been sure that he is #qanda
Our Govt should not be condoning white extremism with their silence #qanda
Panel not very racially diverse #qanda
The cost benefit on that proposed freeway was a disgrace. Only imbeciles in the Abbott govt and the LNP in Vic would back such a dud. #qanda
#qanda If Abbott wants to endear himself to the people, he can start by releasing the asylum seekers.
@QandA was the yelling audience in protest of deportation?
Thank goodness we have a Muslim panelist to take part in this discussion *crickets* #QandA

@QandA you expect tradies and truckies to hop on a train?
A beautiful survivor story for Andrew Robb. Bringing a tear to my eye. #qanda
#QandA these little pricks complaining about police using excessive force, lucky its not the seventies, bring back the tough coppers
Weak excuse. All forms of public transport needs federal funding #QandA
#qanda it's not the PM having a beer that's the issue, it's that he is the PM
@TonyAbbottMHR Since ABC's @QandA brought it back into the spotlight, how about a campaign against Mental Illness? Fight the 7 Ppl/Day stat?
The Australian government is committing acts of great cruelty to the most vulnerable people in our society. Double dissolution. Now. #QandA
Best question of the year #qanda

Let's stop topdown siloing funding of our entrenched social issues &amp; focus on local interventions &amp; building supportive communties  #qanda
@QandA what a bland statement she just gave..
The more we draw attention to 'Muslims fitting in' &amp; people 'standing up for Muslims' the more we ostracize them #QandA

@qanda what an inarticulate bunch of men tonight, let the ladies speak, they are at least able to articulate their thoughts!
maybe Abbott just wanted a beer #qanda
I shudder in fear every time an Australian politicians says the words "we should do it like the US." Nothing about the US is good. #qanda
Our en masse cultural xenophobia stems from our refusal to admit asylum seekers into the country #qanda
Why should the city shut down every time it rains? Why should Victoria rd come to a stand still if a crash occurs anywhere in Sydney? #qanda
Alcoholism - a real problem for Australians that ruins lives, the drinking culture needs to stop. #qanda
It is Aussie Muslims giving alerts that catch terrorist threats, not metadata. #qanda
Western culture teaches us that unless we are 'winning' and happy we are failing. Teach people to 'roll with' sadness. #qanda
Kudos to the police doing a great job catching these butters before they strike.  #qanda
Am reading my book. It does not contain Andrew Robb, Derryn Hinch or any other #QandA shenanigans. Deeply pleasurable.
Not going to resolve the traffic problem? Sure, but it couldn't hurt #qanda

#QandA Not all muslims are terrorists, but, currently, all terrorists identify as muslim. Does Australia really need muslims?
#QandA digging the Twitter feed drinking game. Beats the panel. 5 minutes to stonkered.
Anna Burke, you're spot on! Irresponsible Napthne Gvmt signing this deal for EWllink during an election is irresponsible. #qanda
It was a bad decision. Bad example to youth!   #QandA
#Qanda Doesn't understand money doesn't fix everything. 
Let's not forget in discussing mental health the thousands of asylum seekers at risk, based on this government's decisions. #qanda
Terrorists don't practice Islam. People practicing Islam are not terrorists. These people are not true Muslims. Generalisations hurt. #qanda
I've missed you @DHughesy @QandA
Well done Andrew Robb for speaking the truth, not an easy thing in our culture #qanda
I'm sorry but fear is not an organic part of humanity #qanda

Autistic kid gets deported, yet Abbott's daughter lives at Kirribilli House for $250 a week. Great priorities. #qanda
Who's going to mention how much over the budget EW was going to be #qanda
It's official: Andrew Robb is a monster #QandA
We don't need more roads in this country. We need 21st century public transport!!! #qanda
Someone remind ROBB that Hawke gave up drinking as PM #qanda
In all their posturing about #EWLink LNP eschew any mention of their proposed Melbourne Rail Link proving it was only ever a stunt #qanda
Social urgencies deserving of #Qanda attention - men's violence to women &amp; children, youth suicide, men's suicide, gender pay gap... @QandA
Due to technical difficulties... #qanda
@QandA @AndrewRobbMP Lack of mental health support results in more suicides &amp; drug addiction
#qanda generations change attitudes. Simple
@QandA  how does Hughes get a gig to share his thoughts with Australia. Typical Qanda crap. Hughes has to be Australia's greatest dickwit
Depression is a lifestyle choice taxpayers should not be funding #QandA

We need mental illness help for sportspeople . They're perceived as tough so they can deal with it, when they could be breaking down #qanda
Even if contract wasn't signed it still would be a major snafu, cancelling a project after an 18-month process. People forget that. #QandA
Indeed it was a political exercise Robb. The Libs in Vic tried it on prior the election. #qanda
THIS. And fuck the Robb therapy session RT @Jansant: We intentionally send asylum seekers mad in unsafe and abusive detention centres #qanda
Nice try @JulianBurnside.Dig a bit deeper &amp; u'll find dom violence is entrenched in #muslim families- the ones who commit terror here #qanda
So how long do we have to wait for the Abbott Government to respond to the #National Mental Health Commission's report? #QandA #mentalhealth
We shouldn't let depression,or anxiety or anything similar become something left unspoken #qanda
Disgusting the minister is a twat if he deports a boy for being autistic  #qanda
#qanda Broken promises, Abbott is your expert
#qanda still no mention of US drone-strikes in Pakistan enraging Islam, no mention from @AndrewRobbMP
We need to keep in mind the difference between 'mental health' and 'mental ill-health'. Everyone experiences mental health. #QandA
#qanda Talk about playing to the crowd!
How do you fight Sharia law with a nazi tattoo on your head? Definitely not about race #qanda #sarcasm

Australian culture still has a lot of growing and maturing #QandA
Actually watching six white people sit around a table discussing what "The Muslim Community Needs To Do". Wrong on so many levels. #qanda
Every Islamic terror plot is an opportunity for ABC panelists to tell Australians how racist they are #qanda
So many people suffer from mental illnesses. As much as you feel alone, you're not at all. It's okay to speak up and ask for help #qanda
@mariekehardy I have lost all respect for Anna Burke. All #vegans want is no suffering for animals. How is that extreme? @qanda #qanda

#qanda A lot of problem drinking (&amp; illicit drug use) is self medication for mental health problems including anxiety &amp; depression.
DID I JUST SEE SOMEONE SAY AUSTRALIA ISN'T RACIST? LOLLOLOlolLOLoLOLOLOL I'm done here. #qanda
Deporting this child sends a message about our government and their stance on mental illness and disability. He's not a burden.  #QandA
Is "Team Australia" inclusive? #qanda
@QandA so Abbott had a beer. Get over it!

Exactly, Anna Burke. Acceptance &amp; inclusion are the best way to combat radicalisation. #QandA
@qanda asshat Kennett derided my lived depressive experience on twitter. He's a prick should be sacked. Maybe if I'd been an LNP minister...

@qanda "why are we waiting for people to land at the bottom of the cliff" - thank you Anna Burke.
@mtc01 @RitaPanahi Not at all - but not with #QandA. The issue is with the fake account &amp; Twitter have processes for that.
#qanda great words from Andrew, shows there is no one fix to depression, you need to lean on the support available
I'm so sick of us calling together our experts to not listen to them #QandA

#qanda too many people..too many cars...too much oil...too many guns... and not enough room to go around.. but hey...lets make love NOT war.
Abbott doesn't do public transport. He does overblown tunnels and an open cheque for if the andrews government was elected.   #qanda
@DanielAndrewsMP had a mandate to cancel #EastWestLink. The people voted him in and #Napthine OUT for a good reason. Wear it! #QandA
I've never been a fan of your politics Mr Robb, but power to you and thank you - spread this message of acceptance. #QandA
@QandA all people in Australia need to be taught about diversity and acceptance, sadly older generations are already set in their ways
Let's hear about the #TPP now. #QandA
Andrew Robb has shown tremendous leadership tonight. Discussion on #mentalhealth among men is still very rare. #qanda

#QandA my son is autistic &amp; this disgusts me! Are you going to deport us? Where is the compassion!?
Ah, so no TPP questions after all. How weak #qanda

How might we build social cohesion within our communities and celebrate cultural #diversity? Brilliant @janeburns #QandA @QandA #youth
The questioner is right! How can we stop Daniel Andrews from writing the cheque that the Napthine government already wrote? #qanda #auspol
Brave for a man to admit he's depressed #qanda

#QandA as a parent with a severely intellectually disabled child the NDSA does NOTHING more than before.  It's a croc!
Anyone on this panel going to hold the #LNP to account for their actions on any topic tonight, or is it all just puff, again? #qanda @qanda
@EduSum True-caretaker govts should not sign contracts and expect incoming governments to honour them. People voted loud and clear #qanda
Thought provoking, necessary and open discussion on depression and suicide #qanda

@EmCollin @QandA good one
#qanda By not criticising #reclaimaustralia marches, the LNP didn't show any leadership.
Any extremism and radicalization doesn't just come out of a vacuum. Seriously threaten israel and the present situation would pale! #QandA
Anna Burke is so right, acceptance is key to keeping Australia a great multicultural place #qanda
The LNP won the previous election based on PT, and they reneged. We don't want #EWLink ahead of much needed PT infrastructure #qanda

More roads = more cars and more road congestion. More public transport = less cars and less road congestion'. #duh #qanda

DH hit the nail in the head Australian Legal system...Enough said #qanda
Stigma is still one of the biggest barriers to effective #MentalHealth treatment. We need a national anti-stigma campaign #qanda
We're all gonna die #qanda
Prevention and early intervention, the real circumvention of depression. #qanda @QandA
Derryn if someone was sacked for having depression, that is unfair dismissal #qanda
Atheists are not special Dave, just a little bit smarter #QandA
Napthine wasted  400m by signing dodgy contact. More roads create more traffic, just look at LA! #qanda
#QandA  Depression is not just biological but also associated with unresolved life events or oppression
Hawke was just being himself downing a beer. Abbott was pretending to be someone else. For God's sake he usually mixes it to dilute #qanda
Yeahhhhhhhhhh tell the fianance sector #qanda @QandA
They can't just fix mental health, but they can just stop the boats. Of course.  #qanda
Winner is ....... Ethan ! #QandA #quanda
There are obviously still stigmas but it is improving. The more we talk about it,  the better. #qanda #mentalhealth
The rabble are just looking for reasons to be outraged. It was 1 beer. #qanda
This discussion is damaging my brain far more than a beer I think #qanda
Remember that Joe Hockey said that the poor don't drive #qanda
Mental Health Matters, far reaching consequences for all communities. Funding now!! #QandA
"We're all 'gunna' die..." - @DHughesy with some very deep insight into the promotion of multiculturalism. #QandA
#qanda dodgy, dodgy LNP, caught out
What about dual diagnosis treatment? Shall we ignore that too? It's an epidemic that needs help now not tomorrow #qanda
#qanda So what? It's ok for the PM act like a complete idiot all the time?
Who do these people think they are asking Melbourne-related questions? #QandA
It wasn't just about that skol - it was a reinforcement of Abbott's history of bad judgement. #QandA
#Qanda wake up Anna we've never been an accepting society
This must be what it's like for the rest of the country when they talk about Western Sydney #qanda
Oh Amen, yes bloody put a train line down the Eastern Freeway #qanda @QandA
a very interesting mix of issues discussed on tonight's ep. keen to watch next week's episode with @tomporteous. #QandA @QandA
7 a day. Wow. #qanda @QandA
Anyone that steps up and talks about their experience with mental health issues is to be commended. #qanda
Surprise suprise the Govt is blaming Labor for something. F%# off Robb. #qanda
I find this conversation depressing. #QandA
Andrew Robb is reading his notes. #qanda
Also putting the onus on individuals to 'put their hands up' and 'seek help' isn't constructive when that help isn't available #qanda
LOLWUT #QandA
So simple but so accurate Anna Burke! Extremism not religion that we need to stop #ujcomm2657 #QandA @QandA
Not fond of Koori court? Not fond of a system that is trying to right the imbalance in the legal system? #qanda
@hellosundaymorning mention on #qanda

Ice epidemic in my hometown Geelong is terrifying. Andrews Labor Government fostering some great proactive policy work in this area. #qanda
We can talk about the ice epidemic freely but not a suicide epidemic killing 7 people a day #qanda
Extremism is a consequence of social exclusion, marginalisation and the feelings of futility. Not specific to a religion #qanda
#qanda Hey which city in the world has solved traffic congestion with more roads?
Fully agree with Derryn Hinch!! Many factors are involved with extremism and terrorism not just religion/culture #ujcomm2657 #qanda
@QandA You need evidence to arrest and charge, Derryn.. #qanda
Loving the focus on Australia's #bingedrinkingculture and #mentalhealth on #qanda @qanda. These are the conversations that we need to have.
All this Q&amp;A has got me thirsty. Beer anyone? #qanda #ujcomm2657
Why aren't we spending some of the Future Fund's billions on this problem? #qanda
#qanda Q and A already radicalizes the politically correct
Derryn Hinch is not going back to jail apparently #qanda
Shut up audience member! #qanda
@QandA Ice and ISIS. Young people being lured into extremely dangerous situations #qanda

Public transport in Melbourne is a travesty. Any person who catches a peak hour train will tell you so. #QandA #qanda
If you're looking to Warnie for 'role model' behaviour, you need a drink. #qanda
#qanda has Andrew Robb forgotten about the mental health council which bought small groups together!
You know you're in Melbourne heartland when everyone applauds excitedly at mention of light rail #QandA
quick deflect,deflect,deflect....ice epidemic, ice epidemic. Our huge donations from the alcohol lobby, nothing to see here. #qanda
#QandA Building more roads to get rid of traffic is like putting down bread to get rid of pigeons.
@RitaPanahi @QandA trolling them without even trolling them is next level trolling, Rita.
Sorry Anna but vegans aren't threatening national security #qanda @qanda
#qanda Andrew Robb defending the indefensible
#qanda A calm, level headed, law abiding Derryn Hinch on Q&amp;A tonight. Who is this imposter?
#QandA Secrecy destroys social cohesion.  prison destroys sous. Oz is responsible. Litmus test?
What's wrong with Australia that we struggle so much to talk issues like racism, alcohol, mental health? #QandA @QandA
I've seen lots of people with their kids on public transport. What an odd argument. Perhaps if she argued she was filling her car. #QandA
Yes, Ethan! Why does he have to leave? Disgusted to live in a country that will deport a child because he has #autism #qanda
The national curriculum needs to focus more upon destabilising social and racial stigmas. #qanda
Why? Solider On Brothers n Sisters #QandA
Was that last tweet a satirical comment? #qanda
I want Anna Burke to be my friend. Or at least my ace aunt. #qanda
@qanda #qanda Can one be a Muslim and support democracy? Isn't it a fundamental Islamic belief that religion and State should be one?
Andrew Robb is proof that you can live well and succeed despite depression, don't give up people, you can do it too #qanda
Tony Jones' collar is oversized &amp; crumpled tonight. The dick's head has gone flaccid  #qanda @QandA #auspol
@BrendanFrankly Brother, billions of people don't tell their friends and family about their alcohol abuse. #QandA
The best episode of #qanda for ages. Refreshed by judgement free input on critical personal topics like drinking and mental illness.
#qanda does the islamophobia discussion so painfully week after week
@thecattery @QandA that's 'showing balance', by posting inane fuckardism. Tough on @RitaPanahi.
Ping @QandA  https://t.co/9TAnFzIm77
Yeah, I think I'll pass this week. #Qanda
Would anyone watch #QandA if they didn't put their tweets up on the screen?
No mate, it's not the worst waste of tax payers money. #qanda
Increase public transport #qanda
Bored with the QandA speakers? Come hear this lot instead. http://t.co/GpLJ06oEbz http://t.co/knuV99ZMBf
The fork in the road is when we realise that seeking help. And it's a huge sign toward the road with the better ending. #QandA
@QandA I'm concerned that if you go to a doctor and say 'I'm not ok' they immediately reach for the prescription pad. Over medicating Aust
They should've let Hughesy answer that heckle, what he does for a living #qanda
Everyone knows that Tony Abbott likes a drink.  Not a secret.  #qanda @QandA
I told my boss at the ATO one day I was having an anxiety attack and he said "i'm not going to treat you different" #qanda @QandA
Those protesters took my seat on #qanda tonight! #oxygentheives
Drinking stats continually trending downward - see AIHW stats #qanda
Victorians want public transport. That's what they voted for at the 2014 election. #qanda
Extremism is a vacuous and inoffensive word on its own.  #qanda
@QandA what about the Black Dog Institute.melanchloia trumps depression
#qanda Extremist governments feed off prejudice to keep public focus narrow
Thank god Anna Burke is there she is the good shit #qanda
Shame on us. #qanda
@TonyJones_qanda doing his nightly @MrKRudd joke. #qanda @QandA
Yawn #qanda

Hughes telling it as it is! #qanda
It's not so funny that as divorce has increased, so has depression, suicide and abuse #qanda
I vouch for this, personal experience, Australia has a drinking problem #QandA
There is a great difference between saying that we are accepting of multi-culturalim and actually putting that belief into practice #qanda
Hey #QandA why is Test showing up on your screen?
@QandA A PM is supposed to be above peer pressure as a supposed level headed, adult. What of those responsible drinking campaigns? #qanda
Hawke skols = hero, Abbott skols = irresponsible #qanda
Increasing hospital bed numbers is politically easier to sell than preventative medicine.  It's politics #qanda
OH FFS #qanda

It's not just about young people. #qanda
@AndrewRobbMP knows a lot about 'not taking responsibility'. He is from the most irresponsible government we've ever seen #qanda
The Liberals love the 7K jobs figure; where's the evidence? #EWLink #qanda
Well said Hughesy, get off the drugs and booze, admit a problem  #QandA
Alcohol is actually a central nervous system depressant. #qanda
Alcoholism is more of a problem than ICE #qanda
You are a champ Ethan #qanda
PM had a beer IN PUBLIC, Warnie (and Smokey Joe) smoked IN PUBLIC - Don't drink or smoke IN PUBLIC #QandA
It is all too confusing. Who to blame, who to shame and who to hide from? Muslims, politicians, multiculturalism? I'm lost. #qanda
Julia Gillard would like to hear that. #qanda
Marijuana big cause of schizophrenia  #QandA
So is drinking in Australia illegal? #QandA
The difference between Turkish Muslims and others is that Turkish Muslims have lived in a secular society for nearly 100 years #QandA
@QandA #QandA On a more serious note, although I love beer, I don't think politicians shouldn't be shamed or exalted for drinking or not!
Exactly no point arresting people who pose a threat if the courts don't deal with them appropriately if found guilty!  #qanda
Depression &amp; Alcohol - #qanda is brilliantly on the Australian money!
#qanda Amazing how the kids it.  Perhaps government and adults should listen more
Speaking the truth #QandA
Bitch, shut up ! Rude slag #QandA @QandA
I think it's going too far to blame the broader community for the whole issue... A bit simplistic #qanda
if people want to say having a drink is australian can we just say that repression and irresponsibility is too? cool, great #qanda
I'm on my second rum atm #qanda
My dog has more compassion than half our politicians. #qanda

Skolling a beer is irresponsible drinking?? Seriously. What's your basis for that claim? #qanda
HERE WE GO #QANDA
Refreshing to have some humour amongst a very unhumorous topic @DHughesy @QandA #qanda
OMG Tony having a beer is now all about drinking culture. Krudd and Julia all had drinks on camera: nothing said #qanda
Mental Illness isn't a lifestyle choice - it's a disease @janeburns #qanda
I think that was the best episode of #qanda in a long time
@malaccio1 @MolksTVTalk #qanda brings out the worst in me. Already turned it off. Now, all I need to remember is to turn twitter off too :)
The 'leader' of our country perpetuating drinking culture? #NoThanks #qanda @QandA
Mental Health Review anyone? #qanda  #NMHCReport
Alcohol abuse is endemic in Australia. #QandA
Where can Muslim youths turn to for positive models in the media? Everyone's talking down to them, no one shows them anything else. #Qanda
@two_each that's what I don't understand! To date, Christians have done far more harm to far more children!! @QandA @CARoyalComm
#qanda I doubt skolling a beer will help Tony Abbott. It feels fake. Hawkey he ain't.
Australia has bigger issues than the PM downing a beer. He tried to endear himself to the public &amp; everyone saw through it. Move on #qanda

Drinking like that when your prime minister is not a good look #qanda
I'm still stuck on the litmus test thing. That, and Joe Hockey is blaring Nickelback next door, dancing in his undies. Kill me now. #qanda
@QandA  ICE!!!! It's also alcohol let's focus we got a lot of problems. Prohibition isn't working. Time to try something else.
Seriously it was just a beer, it's not like it was crack? #qanda
@thecattery in fact Burke may be into the votes #QandA
Open discussion is the first step #qanda
A litmus test? How often? #qanda
Do people tweeting at #qanda realise that the TV / presenters don't  reply to the tweets. Just asking for a friend.
Why is terrorism immediately (wrongly) associated with Islam? @QandA #qanda
#qanda get a few more whities in to discuss Islam's 'responsibilities' and nominal heroism from Prime Ministers.
Anna Burke, fuck yeah #qanda
Why not just let the Court determine the facts..the process of law is a litmus test #qanda
#qanda yes but some humans are murderers, rapists or terrorists - we need protection
#Abbott drinks a schooner of piss to try and dilute the fact he's full of shit. #qanda
Nothing I like more that a fresh faced panel of shiny white people lecturing the browns about what they should do. #qanda
There are no differences. We are all straight white men on the inside. #qanda
#qanda Tony Abbott is the one who has done the damage to Australia's reputation, we're a laughing stock
It's easy to spend money when it isn't yours. #qanda

#qanda what happened to questions on tpp that Tony said would be aired later?
Drinking culture. That's more like it @QandA #qanda
Tony Abbott made a poor judgement call. #QandA
east west link was a stinker. Victorians want public transport and the Liberals won't admit roads don't win elections #qanda
R U O K? We need to keep saying it. #qanda
Great question. It's time to face Australia's alcohol problem full on. #QandA
Ridiculous comment regarding the CFMEU #qanda
We just discussed the stigma on Mental Health but now dont want to discuss the stigma on Autism? #QandA
Sharia law may have added benefits of cutting down on problematic drinking.  #QandA
@DHughesy You are spot on Dave Australians drink to get drunk. We have yet to learn how to drink socially and we need to change it. #qanda
Let's be just as heartless to Apple, Google and Microsoft #QandA
Didn't we do a mic test? #QandA
"Why does he have to leave?". Why can't the government see that people with autism are human beings? @QandA #QandA

Young Ethan provided the sanest #qanda video question in years.
Govt haven't had a good record of listening to reports recently #qanda
Don't like the fact that they've classed depression a mental illness, I'm sure they could've come up with something better than that #qanda
What will the government do for mental health funding now that the national report has been leaked. #qanda
Radicalisation starts with exclusion. Exclusion starts when we start to other. #qanda
Silence in the audience. #qanda

Comment of the night Anna Burke @QandA #qanda
@QandA the Attorney-General's department does fund youth focused counter radicalisation programs

Onions and skolling. Welcome to Ausrrslja #qanda
not watching #qanda and by the sounds of it, I'm doing better then the rest of you suckers.
I feel like these topics can't all be discussed properly in an hour ... #qanda @QandA
C'mon @TonyJones_qanda step aside &amp; let Anna Burke chair this one. #qanda
Great to see @yawcrc represented on #QandA tonight. Here's hoping we'll talk about some of the issues that #ausyouth care about
Public transport is the future. Trains, buses, light rail, even high speed rail. #qanda
Public transport much better value than road infrastructure #qanda
How awesome are the roads every time there's a tradies' RDO? Halves my travel time. #qanda
After Clinton's tortilla, I'm underwhelmed by @TonyAbbottMHR's beer drinking #QandA

"Drinking culture" drink! #qanda @QandA
Oh god I thought it was going to be a question about "halal tax" #qanda
@qanda leadership is the key to bringing awareness to the theme of depression. Crucial 2 lessen the stigma by open honest discussion #qanda
#qanda a report released and will the government act on any of it - probably not
The time for consultation around mental health is over. The sector is unified about what is needed now. Action.  #qanda
In the same way the LNP doesn't take responsibility hey Mr Robb? #qanda
De-radicalisation programs? How about stop wearing religion as a label and be Australian like the rest of us. There's an idea #QandA
Alan Jones has said more deeply offensive things (with a golden megaphone) than I can recall any Muslim leader saying #qanda
@QandA #TonyAbbott just needed something to wash down the onion.
'Australian drinking culture' is becoming an excuse to have people throw it in our faces and make us feel bad for not participating @QandA
Waiting for the government to blame the Ice epidemic on Labor. #QandA
It's nice to see you guys talk about mental health illness tonite #qanda #ujcomm2657

@LaLegale @QandA Then life is the problem. Or maybe we don't enjoy the honesty of being alone, introspective. Again, this is 'what'.
@JohnTheLeftist @AyesHavit it's no biggie. I didn't vote lnp I'm no Abbott fan but having a beer...Pfft leave the man alone ffs I say #qanda

@AndrewRobbMP totally right: depression is like any other health condition. You need the right tools &amp; support to manage it. #qanda

#qanda Paraphrased: "I am a white man. What are you doing for me"
Disappointed AustralianAid didn't come up tonight on #qanda especially as it provided clean drinking water to 3.4 million people #dontcutaid
Liberals cut funding fro all the important things - health, education etc etc... #qanda
Merkel, Hawke, Gillard, Rudd having a beer good, Abbott doing it bad. Warnie talking about it very bad. #QandA
#qanda Now we really are talking about something important and useful!
WHAT ABOUT THE TURKS exactly those crooks #qanda
Daniel Andrews is dangerous for Victoria and dangerous for Australia #QandA
Asking Aust Muslims to denounce terrorism is like Aust men being asked to denounce violence against women. Where are the protests? #qanda

@QandA interesting that Melb had a protest for legalising marijuana today as Dave connects the smoking of marijuana with schizophrenia.
#qanda What looks more appealing? Togetherness or extreme violence?
We need to abolish boundaries for access to mental health services. People should not be duck shoved around services. #qanda
East west tunnel or train line......#ujcomm2657 #qanda http://t.co/kAvVMHS0zG
Ice wouldn't be a problem if the community provided appropriate support -jobs, education, health. #qanda
@qanda Why has Tony Abbott not engaged on this given his stance while in Opposition?
For sufferers, stigma hurts more than the illness itself. #qanda
How ignorant can one get? #qanda
@yawcrc @MCG58 @janeburns we need communities that care and accept all #qanda
Why is the road toll always the focus and not suicide? Time to change those billboards #qanda

Real heroes don't need to prove themselves #qanda
#qanda Actually light rail (tram etc) can well be used for freight and garbage outside rush hour - just a bit of logistics

You could probably say the same with the Melbourne Metro project. #QandA
High unemployment, stigmatising those on welfare, cuts to mental health... The Abbott Govt isn't helping #qanda
Rupert Murdoch is a burden on this country, but we just let him syphon $$$ out of the country!!  #qanda

#qanda the easiest way to reduce drinking culture is to stop worrying what other people think of you!!
#QandA the stigma is a cause of suicide. If you feel you won't get a job etc due 2 depression there is a complete feeling of hopelessness
@DalalSmiley #qanda

Mental health conversation on #qanda still frustratingly shallow. More talk about how services are delivered would be nice.

#qanda what? no questions on the TPP? seriously?
Good question #QandA
#qanda East West Link. Why quote Tony Abbott , he never sticks to anything?
Again, 'Islamaphobia' is a made up term by C.A.I.R. People are not 'irrationally afraid' of Muslims, they are concerned about crime. #qanda
@DHughesy knows what's good for Australia ! @QandA Still got the Holden ? #QandA
@clothedvillainy my Silencer extension keeps crashing http://t.co/G49f9fWnYE because it's hiding entire pages of #qanda, I know you're proud

@MsRonnyB @QandA  that's my type of democracy.

Anna Burke and Andrew Robb are good reps for their parties. Can readily listen to them.  #qanda
The only things the kids arrested in "terror raids" this week had were  a household knife and ornamental sword #qanda
@leein140 this is what #qanda should be. Not bickering between panel as normal.
Part of problem is terrorism is a global problem even more so with Internet. 14 year old in UK working with teens in Aus shows this #qanda
Mental illness is an illness not a lifestyle choice #qanda
Did someone really just justify the Cronulla riots? #qanda

READ THE BLOODY QUESTION #QandA
What a great question, especially for those who need awareness on dealing with depression #qanda
Tonight's #qanda jumped the shark especially early.
This #qanda panel though.
Yes, I really could have run my gardening business with a train for transport. The #QandA followers are clowns.
All religions promote intolerance, some more than others #QandA
Scary figures #qanda

Doesn't matter how much we "say" we are the same, racism, gender inequality, sexism everything still exists. #qanda
@musictravelpoly no #qanda tonight?
#qanda Most violence is committed by men. By that 'litmus test' idea, should all men have to overtly reject violence?
@QandA The LNP has always preferred roads,this lines the pockets of their trucking mates.
seeing the panel speaking so honestly upon personal experiences with mental illness brings a much needed realness to the discussion. #QandA
FFS he skolled a fucking beer. Get over it. #qanda
Given the way trucks drive, it's in all our interests to take some off the road #qanda
#qanda @QandA deradicalisation works because people can be won over when you force them to empathise with the people they supposedly hate
We love pubs but hate the injecting centre? Which one promotes safety? #qanda
#qanda oh for god's sake! Another thing for schools &amp; teachers to do - de radicalise youth! You better fund them up the wazoo if u want that

I am glad to see that @AndrewRobbMP got his CFMEU bash on #qanda He is keeping to the  party line
So tragic that so many are so lost in our society. But not at all surprising. #qanda
Fuck I actually needed to brace myself for that opening #qanda
i have a feeling this panel is going to get to the bottom of radicalisation tbh #qanda
@WillyHeard there's enough of the looney left on #qanda tonight without more. #theirabc
Melbourne crowd getting rowdy. Classic. #qanda
It would have cost more to build the East West Link #QandA
Religion serves a single purpose which is to breed hatred and intolerance #qanda
Don't say something unless it's worth going to jail for, Derryn Hinch #qanda
Thank you #qanda for discussing #mentalhealth
Excellent question posed by Ethan! #QandA
@mtc01 @RitaPanahi #QandA publishing people's statements with attribution meets EdPol. Simple as that.
I'm getting depressed watching Q&amp;A #qanda
Can we deport the government! #qanda
Seriously, though, they should be discussing the stuff out of that shit. #QandA #TPP
Irresponsible drinking? The Mad Monk strikes back! #QandA
'Tiny hearts' &amp; 'balls of steel'.Is this really what the world thinks of Australia? | @JulianBurnside http://t.co/pD1vnzHVeu #qanda #auspol
Expecting big things from @HumanHeadline tonight. #QandA
QLD's health payroll system at $1.4bn trumps VIC's measley east west link's $360m cancellation #qanda
Unfortunate note to start on #qanda
Oppression &amp; exclusion of other races can cause mental illness too- #discrimination &amp; #MentalIllness #correlate #qanda
#qanda Napthine should not have signed a contract 2 weeks from an election
Good to see so much time on terrorism - it's killing one Australian woman a week after all. #qanda
I don't think the PM has caught the Frankston train for a while #QandA
STFU audience on @QandA
Public Transport, great for inner city #greens  to get to coffee shops, useless for rest of metro area #auspol #qanda
Give me a spell crucifying Abbott for having 1 beer #qanda
This can and do get better. Andrew Robb is proof. #qanda
Well said again @DHughesy #qanda
Whoopin' and a hollerin'. #qanda
I note qanda seems to be on. In an unrelated question, is it possible to mute all tweets containing a hashtag without muting their authors?
Depression is such a massive issue in schools - stories like these help #qanda
@two_each @QandA @CARoyalComm Who says we are?
Best question / topic of the night. #qanda
Families of sufferers need support, Now! #qanda
#QandA time! Hinch on should be fun
Ohh and to think Andrew Robb just 10 minutes ago accused Anna Burke of "Defending the Indefensible" #IronyOverload #qanda
#qanda Dave Hughes never has anything of any great value to contribute to the topics at hand. Why do you continue to invite him back?

Reagan had altzheimers for half of his presidency. #qanda
A phobia is not a fear - its an irrational fear. Hence Islamaphobia is a misnomer because it is not irrational #QANDA #Islamaphobia
peer pressure? or democracy #qanda @QandA
It sucks being told that a certain medication will make everything better, and then it doesn't. It's a special kind of hopelessness. #qanda
Andrew Robb thank you for your candour #qanda
@QandA Abbott is just an idiot, always has been and always will be, give us another chop at a vote
#qanda fuck, arent you listening both acute beds and community services are needed. 35-50 yr oldmen arent young people. @QandA
#qanda Moslem leaders don't  have to denounce extremists any more than Christian leaders should decry Westboro Baptist Church.
Why can't we see the contents of the TPP agreement? Ashamed? Scared? @QandA #qanda
This is absolutely appalling! That poor kid #qanda
Nobody likes a hospital bed. Especially the mentally ill. #qanda
Tonight's #QandA panel looks true blue Strayan!
Stop blaming Daniel Andrews. Blame the people who signed the stupid contract just weeks before the election. #qanda
#qanda great first question... downhill from there
So glad my son was born in Australia so his autism can't be considered a 'national burden'... So ashamed of our government right now #qanda
If the community is fearful, it's partly because Abbott bobs up at the first mention of a terror raid to look like the hard man. #qanda
Deporting that mother and child is the representation of what the current government thinks of people in general #qanda
Ah yes, It's not #qanda without some stupid protest we can't even hear
#qanda #auspol If rugby league players have to be drinking role models surely so does the PM
Stuff Today Tonight. #QANDA to get my personal cases special attention
The govt leaked that mental health review so they could dismiss the idea of pulling money from acute to preventative care. #qanda
Already @QandA the question is disappointing
Open discussion about depression necessary to pull it back from under the rug #RespectforRobb #qanda
I'm thankful that I sometimes wake up on Sunday not remembering the night before. #qanda
Not every car is a truck and not every truck is a car. Just sayin #qanda
Should I be treating tonight's #qanda as a media law lesson?
@TitanicQueen @QandA Didn't want t say it but I remember and it was only 9pm. He was obviously on a bender since lunch.
This is great @AndrewRobbMP ! Why oh why did you convince the Liberals to abandon climate change action though??? #qanda
Perfectly healthy people can get depression for various reasons. Managing it is different than mental illness. #qanda
@RitaPanahi @QandA Shitful, don't praise them up!!
The #qanda audience is pretty horrid tonight, but in comparison to that woman next to hinch, they're rather eloquent and educated
#qanda If you teach children that they evolved from slime,  is it surprising they see no purpose in life??
Watching #qanda &amp; could do with someone to chat to safely? 
Many #mental health problems are propped up by alcohol &amp; drugs yet public think promoting binge drinking &amp; alcohol is acceptable? #QandA
#QandA   Australia apparently has a little heart and steel balls - an example here
#QandA In mental health, the stigma is more deadly than the illness.
#qanda  Anna Burke please take up cause asylum seeker children in detention or born in detention some bear no citizenship birth certificate
Oh so now Derryn is careful about commenting on matters before the courts #qanda
Pretty telling that the best question of the night was asked by a ten year old. #qanda
If we want to tackle depression in Australia, we need to stop othering depressed people. Read Foucault and learn. #qanda
@QandA #QandA Are the audio issues related to @AndrewRobbMP being on the show. Have ABC's audio techs finally had enough #LNP Spin?
State elections aren't referendums on anything, and they don't constitute a mandate for any policy. It's a general election, get real #qanda
Early Intervention and High Quality Early Education and Care go hand in hand. This needs to be recognised! #qanda
Andrew Robb offering absolutely nothing on #qanda. This guy is supposed to be amongst the best talent in the coalition. #auspol
#qanda #DanKirner can't be trusted Lied Mislead Vic voters 'No Compensation' what crap 640M for Nothing #springst http://t.co/pVIRzFF1y9
Glad you're discussing the big issues, it was just a beer get over it. #qanda
Tony needs to turn back religion #QandA
#QandA #illridewithyou
Hughesy on #QandA, get ready for the unexpected.
If Tony Abbott was honest it's surprise me. #qanda
we need more funding in #mentalhealth not shifting the deck chairs on the titanic Disease Burden 13% Funding less than 5% #qanda
@Rowans_Graffiti LOLZ...yeah..go Hughsey #qanda
#qanda that's it no religion.
Having a title/nickname of @HumanHeadline as a journalist is pretty sweet. #QandA
If people feel unaccepted in their community then of course they are going to go to extremes #qanda
Daniel won. Full stop. #qanda
Blanket treatments do not work for mental health patients. #qanda
#qanda - young kid = human being Brilliant!
Thank you Anna Burke. Legend #qanda
Why is @HumanHeadline talking about a matter that is before the courts? #qanda
Liver cancer can be related to drinking #QandA
@QandA fancy Anna Burke having very little to contribute about anything #stillpointless #qanda
Warney isn't a drink much at all ANY MORE. #QandA
Robb, the reason its not working is because our government is spreading fear &amp; hate #QandA
I see a common thread in the solutions to all of tonight's issues...good motherhood. Love ya mum! #QandA
Sport/drinking culture is a long running problem in Australia.. But if I was PM then I'd be skulling more than 1 beer.. #QandA #UJCOMM2657
#qanda the fear about Muslims smacks of Macarthy era? @qanda
I doubt Abbott thought it through at all #qanda
Govt more concerned about stopping the boats than dealing with actual issues #qanda
I'd like to see Andrew Robb 'defend the indefensible.' #qanda @qanda
Hepatic cirrhosis is a risk factor for some liver cancer, Darren. #qanda
@kateiselin @RitaPanahi @QandA I, too, refuse to appear on #qanda

@QandA @DHughesy well done for telling your story Hughesy
@mwyres and stop all the medications - help them find a way to cope Medications make it worse #ExperienceTalks #QandA
Everyone's an expert on the black dog, but not the causal elephant of depression. #QandA
Bike paths and bike storage connected to punctual, clean and regular public transport. #qanda
There are medical reasons for depression but are lifestyle pressures a cause? #qanda
Not certain whether Anna Burke is showing leadership on mental illness by going to a funeral  #qanda
the more we practice fearing others, the more radicalised and disconnected we become #QandA
The courts just don't have the nads to chemically castrate 'em, Derryn. #qanda
I thought this was supposed to be part of the comedy festival, this is not funny at all ! #qanda
@DHughesy #AllTheSame good on ya Hughesy! @QandA #QandA
German comment: utter bullshit. Has always been heightened, all decades that I remember (cough. .. 3 well enough now) #qanda
I reckon @TonyAbbottMHR should use public transport for a week, and see how it affects his productivity. #qanda
Can we please move on from this now? #QandA
Local solutions so the person gets the right care at the right time, absolutely #qanda
#qanda  Recovery is possible.
Anna Burke telling it like it is :) #qanda
Have the NatLibs blamed Labour, yet? I did not watch from the start. #qanda
#qanda @QandA unfortunately Australian society (and humans) are not 100% accepting of different... Even when coexisting daily.
Don't try and defend the indefensible Andrew #qanda
It took me 5 years to ask for help 4 months later I'm so much better. Guys it's tough to admit it, but better when you do. #qanda
A discussion of ANZAC Day? I can hear the black armbands snapping in the #qanda dressing room already.
@J_says_ missed it. What did Ethan say? #qanda
The toughest man in the pub is the one who is surrounded by drinkers and who says, No, I'll be right. ~ Dave Hughes. #qanda. Too right.
"Look, I know the deportation of a disabled child SOUNDS terrible, but..."-Andrew Robb's take on "I'm not X, but..." trope on #qanda #auspol
The Education system is responsible for the perpetuation of white culture as superior. How about starting with that?! #qanda
'The war on drugs' ignores the biggest drug problem - alcohol abuse #qanda

ICE is not as much of an issue as mental health #qanda
#qanda There's money for deradicalisation but not for #Gonski
Anyone find it weird that this is a panel without a muslim talking about issues about islam. This discussion is kind of redundant. #qanda
Just because you're depressed doesn't mean you're capable of polishing a turd, Andrew Robb. Endless drivel. #qanda
#QandA Good stuff from Andrew Robb, champion of dealing with depression and mental health. Thanks Minister you're a legend.
Oh quick, Abbott had a drink just like every other Aussie...let's debate about it #qanda
Love his honesty #qanda
#qanda Ethan, a child, embodies compassion and decent instincts. Can't our adult govt have the same?

Ethan should run for parliament. Much more smarter than the people in government #qanda
Andrew Robb - they are! Your government just chooses to say they aren't to keep the bogans afraid #qanda
Anna Burke, how I admire, respect and miss you! #qanda #auspol
@QandA Melbourne need a lot more than new roads and light rail to be better than Sydney. Keep trying Melbourne.
@QandA until we have decent responsible leadership in this country this will prevail, belt up rhetoric has taken Australia down a dark path
who is not accepting? #qanda
I think all the homeless people tonight would completely ignore Abbott's drinking for a bed tonight. #qanda
SURPRISE SURPRISE!! A Liberal minister whining "but Labor did it!" #qanda
#qanda hallelujah dave
anna burke u have my heart #qanda
@thecattery @QandA it's been promised for over 50 years. Govt should build it in middle of freeway &amp; then do connections to it from suburbs
Milk ~ the best solution #QandA
Dog whistle politics has worked very well in Australia #qanda
Suicide is the leading cause of death of people between 15 and 44 according to the Australia Bureau of Statistics @qanda #qanda
Stigma is when people have preconceived notions about the driver guy from Top Gear. #qanda
Can we look into macho male culture in Australia causing violence instead... #Qanda @Qanda
#qanda We need new strategies to deal with Ice
*muffled shouting from someone in crowd* #qanda
Drinking and blokeyness need to be separated #SmashTheStigma #qanda
Andrew Robb is a great role model for those suffering depression. #qanda
Time for more respect for our mental earth experts! Should be a bipartisan approach #qanda
Just today I heard of someone who wouldn't tell their boss they had depression because they were worried for their job. #qanda
What a great return serve by Anna Burke. Game set match. @QandA #qanda
Perhaps there was nothing to hold them on! #QandA
A man can't have a beer anymore without the do gooders wanting to crucify us #qanda
It was inevitable that this came up. #qanda #Abbottsbeer
Sports institutions have a lot of power to break down stigmas #qanda
Are we deporting autistic kids? WTF! #qanda
@TaraNipe If you care for someone 24/7 then you end up with financial problems no matter what you do #qanda
Its great to get to watch #qanda again
Taking medication for my depression and anxiety improved my quality of life immensely. I only regret I didn't do it years ago. #qanda
Oh here we go again... #QandA
Invest in the bush - get people out of the cities. No more infrastructure needed. #qanda
#QandA _ stop funding chaplains in schools and fund mental health
We can't ask Muslim community to take responsibility for radicals among them if we can't take responsibility for racists in ours #qanda
I think Dave Hughes' is a simple but smart guy! #qanda AndrewChitty
#QandA urban planners fix the problems everyone didn't realise they had. #AndPeopleStillDontKnowWhatMyDegreeIs
I am so fortunate with my group of friends and my bf. We openly discuss anxiety and depression, its a relief knowing we aren't alone #qanda
It's young people like me who should be listening to this also #QandA
Bravo Hughesy. A bloke telling it like it should be. #QandA
Q&amp;A is right on the money tonight. Good to see Hughesy holding his own! #QandA
#qanda Trucks deliver everything except babies, we need the East West link this is a fact !!
Oh christ Andrew Robb, stop trying to make this okay - it's not #qanda
#qanda in schools! ?!?! Ha! Not with the CHAPLINS program in effect provding a Christian only perspective.
I need a drink. #qanda
#QandA why don't we just ban drinking?
The PM is a poster boy for healthy living, has one beer and is suddenly a binge drinker. Go figure #qanda
@regnans - yep - light weight effort by #qanda http://t.co/OTlK6K4qbO
15 years is incredibly long for diagnosis - we need change #QandA
How come their are no minority's on the panel? #qanda
.@gimerm By the looks of things that tweet from @MariamVeiszadeh was even too radical for #QandA
Most human  I've ever seen Andrew Robb, talking about his depression #qanda
#qanda http://t.co/mz99Gp0hyp
Napthine knew he'd lose the election. He knew Andrews wouldn't build the road. Yet still signed the contracts. Ridiculous. #qanda
I'll back small businesses for as long as I live. They're bullied! #QandA
When we are busy only putting Christian preachers into schools, we are creating a new generation of radicals already #qanda
#QandA historically yes, roads-roads-roads. but there is a whole new generation of people trying to change this. don't generalise.
that boy is quite obviously a green plant @QandA #qanda
We just talked about ice addiction - governments have road addiction @QandA #QandA
What if friends, family &amp; the 'village' REALLY cared if someone's ok? It often takes a stranger who's getting paid 2 listen #qanda
#qanda the new Avengers movie opens this week - is that why
I really hate these live shows in a lot of ways because of yelling and carry on from the audience. Shut up and wait your turn. #QandA
Now this national show has descended into bitching about local transport issues can I bring up the urine smell at Prahran Station? #qanda
Ice is chicken and egg. Many people use drugs to self medicate a pre-existing problem. Address mental health early #qanda
Dear Mr Robb, Mr Hinch and other white male leaders. Please speak out louder against white supremacists in this country. #qanda
Was that a naked man on #qanda or is my TV playing games?
How many roads must a man drive down before he admits he's lost #mentalhealth @QandA
We also signed an international convention to protect our wetlands, and another to look after refugees, but we ignore those #qanda #auspol
Hughesy making it funny #QandA
Martin Square? Oh oh Robb, do better than that. #qanda
and all my #qanda t-shirts are here http://t.co/uSGPv7ri0N
I told my boss I had depression.  He sacked me. #qanda. @humanheadline
Fund mental heath properly and perhaps we would eliminate a fair proportion of 'terrorist prospects' #QandA
@AndrewRobbMP you Sir deserve a standing ovation #QandA
Andrew Robb, fantastic. Remove the stigma. Understand. Help people to improve. #QandA
I skulled a pint once. It was terrible O.O #qanda
East-West Link: Isn't this the old-fashioned concept of "cutting your losses"? #qanda
"We" discriminate on religion so why not a medical condition? #QandA @QandA
My parents where denied immigration when I was a baby becase of a wonky eye and undecended nut... Such a drain on health system #qanda
Great #qanda tonight, discussion on depression. Dave Huges, Andrew Rob, Derryn Hinch. Get on it! Mental health is a community issue.
Hinchy on fire early! @QandA #qanda
none of this is good #qanda
Piss off Tony and leave Andrew Robb alone #QandA
@qanda What about the mental health if asylum seekers in detention centres in our name? #refugees #qanda
Qanda we are not tolerant are we Derryn
So Andrew #Robb thrives on solar endorphin hit. Is that why Abbott thinks the sun shines out of his political proverbial? #QandA
@QandA New citizenship should be probationary so serious criminals including terrorists can be deported.
How about you listen to your peak bodies. They DO bring together the multiple players in a coordinated way #qanda
Keep talking,  Andrew. We need to hear this #QandA
Hmmm...maybe the Premier was also being careful because this is before the courts, Derryn. #qanda
@molkstvtalk I don't think one person on the @Qanda panel could survive any travel chalanges
Mental health professionals are needed urgently in high schools. Stop youth suicide now! #qanda
Some of the world's greatest leaders an thinkers and innovators all were faced with mental illness at some point in their life. #QandA
Ooh Dave Hughes is on #qanda I do so love his economics lessons.
Mental health shouldn't be clouded by the stigma that it is. It's okay not to be okay. And it's okay to talk about it. #qanda #ujcomm2657
Come on, the East West link is a small project in a small part of Melbourne. We'll survive. #qanda
A lot of empty seats at #qanda tonight...
#qanda This fear Andrew Robb is the responsibility of both our Government and the Media and jerks like you
Good stuff Andrew Robb. #QandA
Much talk of 'rules' and public opinion, but no-one seemed to mention plain compassion or common decency. #qanda
.@Msloulou77 for #qanda and/or PM
Nobody can ever have too much mental health support #qanda
@NicNewling has the right idea. Let's talk real shit. @QandA #qanda
@QandA I'm going thru what you went thru now Hinch.
Dutton, no IQ, no EQ. No idea, #qanda
Classic baby boomer attacking gen y for binge drinking. What a surprise  #QandA
#qanda  it is soo frustrating that we in central standard time and further west are excluded from the time appropriate Twitter feeds
Hmmm yes religion is tough terrorism is tough why have any opinions at all why am I even on #qanda
At last a serious question on #qanda - perhaps the first ever! Depression a terrible epidemic
Now about that mental health report which was recently leaked showing failures to support victims #qanda
Anna Burke for PM! #qanda
Great point "If he can get along with us &amp; we can get along with him why does he need to leave?" In this case rules need to be broken #QandA
Sorry Anna but the problem lies in the ALP supporting illegal queue jumper boat people corrupting our nation #Qanda
Why should all Muslims have to come out and condemn what extremists do? Do all Christians over Christian terrorists? #qanda
Anna Burke's right. We can't go about scapegoating specific groups #qanda @qanda
Actually Hinch they are 'alleged' terrorist. #QandA
#QandA did she just compare vegans to IS radicalists!?
Refreshing conversation on #qanda tonight; bravo
Where was the business case? How many tolls were required? Want bipartisanship? Don't hide the facts #QandA
If everyone who spent money on ice donate that money to charity, everything would be free #qanda
@AndrewRobbMP great stuff #qanda
@qanda Hinch is fearing it up big
Defining all misery as "mental illness" can sadly become an all too easy excuse for a society that inflicts pain on its vulnerable. #qanda
#qanda I want to catch a train, alas no passenger train has come past here since 1993.
Not to #qanda don't get Hughsey to comment on political issues. Just don't
Surely we need to look at why depression rates are increasing every decade @QandA #qanda
#QandA Derryn speaks of the elephant in the room.
Make people accountable to their actions outside of work, threatening a person's job should stop racism #qanda
Instead of building massive hospitals and trying to adequately resource them, let's focus on preventative health and healthy living #qanda
How many cases don't make #QandA ?
Abbott has a love of beer and onions, whatta bloke!! #TrueBlueAye #qanda
#qanda It's bad to stigmatize people about depression but ok to stigmatize refugees on mental illness
Why don't we blame all Catholic people for sexual abuse like we blame all Muslims? #qanda
Terrible but draw a line.  If it was HIV #qanda
Show your a real Aussie, binge on onions! #qanda
If #qanda needs to talk about Ice, AND we do, then we need to talk about the far more devastating drug - alcohol.
Could you imagine Obama or any other respectable world leader getting themselves caught on camera skilling? #qanda
WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR ALL THE LITMUS PAPER? ARE WE MADE OF GST FUNDING? #QandA
Ok #qanda panelists this is not a boastfest on how much you drink!
#qanda WOW..that seemed a carefully scripted road remark.
Drinking is my favourite past time, and IM FINE!!! @QandA #QandA
@QandA as a resident of the Northeastern suburbs of Melb, I'd love to see a trainline built. Its been suggested for more than 100 years ago
Just let Tony drink his onion juice in peace. #qanda
Stupid question #qanda
#qanda Government inertia is killing people.....
I love that they didn't answer the question. #qanda
It would be a joke if it weren't so shameful #qanda  https://t.co/5C4rn4qK3O
The different pills and the different levels of pills can be Hell, for some people and still don't work! @QandA
Stop calling depression an "epidemic" please #QandA
@Matt2146 @MariamVeiszadeh Oh that wouldn't worry me. Just don't continually whinge about it when you convert to #Islam .. #qanda #auspol
#qanda Andrews won because Victorians didn't want the road.
Abbott skulling a beer is embarrassing, sad and unnecessary. And irresponsible given the problem with alcohol!  #QandA
Surely that was a statement, not a question. #qanda
#QandA the report came out in public only after ABC brought out some leaks
Did @HumanHeadline just do away with the presumption of innocence in the legal system? #qanda
@bencubby @kateiselin @RitaPanahi @QandA I wish they'd just leave good drunk patriots like us alone tbg
Cheaper to spend this money now, instead billions on a road that will lose money... #qanda
Just in case anyone was wondering about the definition of a TV show degeneration, Hughesy &amp; Hinch are on #qanda
we are obsessed with hospital beds in this country #qanda
Is Hinch answering the question  #qanda
No private gathering in front of TV cameras #qanda
Yep let's blame schools for radicalised youth and everything else wrong with society #qanda
Trying to tweet clever &amp; witty things but can't hear the discussion over the Sydney rain #QandA
In all my schooling we were never told about Ice. That's a problem b/c it's my gen affected #QandA
@RitaPanahi @QandA the ABC taxpayer funded Fact Check Unit obviously doesnt do an afternoon shift.
Sovereign risk is THE single biggest furphy. Throw a damn shoe. #qanda
Spending money not to build a road #qanda
Millions of kids have issues, Australia does not have the money,resource or power to treat every child worldwide - where is the line? #qanda
Mental Health is a personal journey, but hey, our government tells us we're all the same, put us in one box altogether - silly!! #QandA
No one depicts Catholicism as a child sex abuse religion so why paint Islam as an extremism religion?? Makes no sense #ujcomm2657 #qanda
#qanda it's a disgrace something like this happens in Australia
Never woke up with a hangover for smoking weed... Happy 420 QandA @qanda
Stroking a beard releases endorphins that prevent depression. #qanda
Stop corporate tax evasion and privatisation of public services. Enough for everyone, less pollution #qanda
@NassimKhadem @QandA well they keep saying you need the new rail tunnel first so maybe it will finally get done ;-)
Dave Hughes on #qanda this is going to be a good night
The PM trumpeting on about #terror is about disconnecting #qanda
@qanda Robb did good to clarify talking about self only - medication discussion - good job qanda
Thanks to our CEO Associate Professor @janeburns for her informative, thought provoking+ inspiring contributions to tonight's @QandA panel
'We're all individuals' I'm not tho #qanda

Qanda what's practicing religion in "the normal way" Robb?
The Muslim leaders n community have been speaking out. Media has no interest in reporting #QandA
#qanda don't have comedians on
Everything in Australia is sport. Drinking is sport. Unfortunately with drinking the winner is the loser. Acceptance is the enabler. #qanda
If the trade minister's trade deals were so not secretive, heckling from #qanda crowd may not be so necessary #qanda http://t.co/GR6Rabnda1
Mental health needs to be tackled at a grassroots level, and quickly. #qanda
So glad we didn't waste $10bn on a stupid car park #EWLink #qanda
For starters the govt can act now and not promise another review on a review! #qanda
Massive shout out during #qanda for  @ckraine and #hellosundaymorning. Nice work mate.
#qanda people join isis and terrorist groups because of foreign policy, this is the only reason why.
A very young questioner. There's hope yet. #qanda
the only person I understand is @DHughesy #manofthepeople #qanda
It is a terrible situation #qanda @qanda that's why it sounds it...
Already disgusted by the biased subliminal leftism of #QandA

Can we talk about the Trans Pacific Partnership? Lets get a conversation going. #qanda
Robb: the community is at a level of fear I have not seen for a while. There it is, fear aided and abetted by your govt. #qanda
Rita Panahi pops up on #qanda. wind up the ABC, this is cooked
Hey @HumanHeadline it's not Aussie Blokes that drink like @TonyAbbottMHR it's just dickheads #qanda
Sick of being told how racist Australian's are. Not true generally. #qanda
"On the panel tonight, five white people discuss racism and being a minority in Australia." #QandA
The most disaffected are melbourne demons fans #qanda
I'll take that as a pathetic protest. #qanda
So they didn't have time to discuss the TPP #qanda
Is it extremism we need to knock out/not a particular religion. How about denouncing the "special" privileges of all religion #qanda
Everyone has smartphones, Robb. #qanda
#qanda Mindspot clinic online and telephone support for mental health can improve access for all Australians
I'm a lefty and even I can see 2 people just rudely cut off Andrew Rob... make that 3, let him make his point for ducks sake #QandA

#qanda  Napthine Govt committed a crime against Victoria &amp; integrity.A bloody disgrace.
Abbott was looking for a camera shot, it was a set up, attempt to be cool to younger voters! #QandA
Stop wasting the money spent on border protection and locking up refuges and spend it on preventing the 7 daily Aussie suicides #qanda
All mental illnesses need to be talked about, we need to do more to break the stigma's. #QandA
Is ASIO investigating this Muslim ? How dare he mention Islamophobia #QandA
Just saying - called that before Robb did #qanda
Tim Fischer on #qanda next week. A great man he is
Rail is the way to go.  Look at mainland Europe.  No brainer Abbott government. ..#qanda @QandA
Yep let's deport the vulnerable that's such a good example of an adult government #qanda
#qanda How can people who scream "it's my body; I can do what I want" be upset when some choose suicide? Philosophically inconsistent.
@QandA good to talk about depression. De-stigmatise and share coping mechanisms. Brilliant
Definitely an act of peer pressure #qanda http://t.co/7tgOrTjjYe
Should we make all Christians pay for the few crazy fanatics? @QandA
Love how Hughsey proves you can be a great bloke and not be a drinker #QandA
Five Australian Muslims are arrested for plotting terror attacks on Anzac Day &amp; the #qanda panel want to discuss ... tackling Islamophobia!!
On infrastructure we turn to the Old El Paso girl who says "can't we have both?" #QandA
@FlickReynolds 'Fear leads to hate. Hate leads to anger. Anger leads to suffering'. Yoda needs to be on this #qanda panel.

@QandA the sporting sponsors want you enjoy their drink - yeah the sponsors probably had an influence on Warne
.@AndrewRobbMP very powerful , very brave , very insightful description of his struggle with depression #qanda
Derryn Hinch speaking negatively about the courts is pretty disingenuous #qanda
You want to stop extremism in Australia ?? Get out of M/east !! Hello  #QandA
You can't cut an addiction without a replacement. Legalise safer drugs, then alcohol will begin to leave the culture. @QandA #qanda

What a fantastic list of coping mechanisms for depression from Andrew Robb on #qanda tonight
Well done #qanda for dedicating significant air time to tackle the tough subject of #mentalhealth in Australia. Quash the stigma. #illness
The rise in Islamaphonia directly correlates to the misrepresentation of Islam by the media. @QandA #dontletthetruthgetinthewayofagoodstory
Australia has an excessive alcohol consumption problem. It's in our culture. #qanda
Mental illness is invisible. The stigma has to change &amp; it needs to be brought to light by everyone- not just the victims #qanda #ujcomm2657
Great when politicians move away from party script #qanda
#qanda You can't "fund"  away despair, you can stop legislating the "legal" persecution, uphold human rights and dignity that cause it.

We can't afford to keep our current roads in decent shape? Why are we so busy building more and more? #QandA
Andrews actually saved the tax payer money by paying the consortium's costs which was fair after the Libs wasted their time. #QandA

Happy to catch qanda tonight, good lineup
Australians believing in this day and they can drive a car into the inner city in a short time are quite delusional #QandA
@QandA If this was not a staged act than  Tony really is a flog wit!!! He knows people are always watching... Responsibility of position!!
Will our media ever ask disaffected youth why they became radicalised? #qanda
Dave has pointed out that marijuana can cause schizophrenia related problems! #qanda
I can't believe @QandA is in Melbourne and I'm not even there... I'll just watch Tony from the couch as usual. At least my couch has wine.
If suicide is such an endemic problem, why does the mainstream media still have a policy to sweep it under the rug? #qanda
It never goes away but the meds help manage it but still prefer people don't know #qanda
There's a clear response about what people really think of whether it's good money to spend on rail vs road #qanda
It helped that he was a good Prime Minister. #qanda #hawkey

Stigmatising jobseekers and income management contributes to depression. #qanda
There should be a #qanda where all of the questions are asked by kids.
I have a question for the panel: That guy is racist. #QandA
TANYA TANYA TANYA TANYA! #qanda
Human headline should be sent out by Anna under section 94 #qanda
The problem w Aussie male drinking culture is that it leads to violence. #qanda

Terrorism, drug addiction , depression suicide AND public transport in Melbourne! All topics covered roll up roll up #QandA
#qanda Anna Burke...wonderful passionate leader
It's not islamophobia, it's straight-up racism #QandA
I need a drink to get through this conversation on #qanda
Our legal system is broken and doesn't work anymore. There isn't anywhere to send criminal's.  #QandA
No Tony, it doesn't. Germany has massive problems with their Muslim population. #qanda #waytofail
If #qanda @qanda @TonyJones_qanda doesn't ask Andrew Robb about the secrecy around the TPP it will be a disgrace.
Most people go through depression some stage of life. Best way is to see a Doctor &amp; talk Sensible Caring Friends &amp; enjoy the life #QandA
I don't want to live in a country with rules like that and I'm not moving #qanda
@Paulie68 @QandA that's because you're overseas people
Tony Abbott lost the chance of being cool with the youth of Australia when he ate a raw onion on national television. #qanda
shame when people from remote indigenous communities can't access support because their communities have been shut down. #ujcomm2657 #qanda

Many, many people suffer from depression. So glad the stigma is lessening. #qanda

Andrew Robb makes a ton of sense and gets no claps. #qanda
Rail. Not roads. #qanda
#QandA Yeah c'mon Robb let's hear . Spit it out. cunt.
There is  breakdown of trust and respect of leaders because of their lack of principle. Society has become a bleak landscape. #auspol #qanda

R U kidding #qanda you have the trade minister on and no #TPP question?
@QandA @janeburns Why is Oz terrorising children by imprisoning them?
But asking for help when you're depressed is hard - what if no one responds? #qanda
#QandA  A guzzling and dribbling PM is not a good sight
@QandA #qanda Are we hypocritical when we say our country is better for all the cultures and thoughts when we protest in ReclaimOz events?
Mental illness is not an area where small Government arguments hold true. #QandA

Sorry, but you don't "prevent" mental illness - you help people through it... #qanda

#qanda The Trouble With All Drugs is..... $ s and wars and  Corruption.... and lives ruined.

#qanda I wish there was as much passion about preventing suicides as building roads
We do need to de-stigmatise mental illness. It will be difficult because we all fear it. #qanda
I doubt the PM is capable of acting with spontaneity #qanda
#qanda I'm loving Dave more with every passing joke, tonight!
Is every Catholic priest a pedophile? Is every Muslim a terrorist? Is every angry bloke a wife basher? Our responses have to be fair. #qanda
@QandA speaking from first hand experience, the public mental health system is frightening. #qanda
Alcohol lobby too powerful #qanda
Refugees are asking for help - so, what when asking for help stigmatises big-time? @QandA
#qanda welcome all
Suppression orders are anti-democratic. #QandA
Prevention not intervention - well said Anna Burke #qanda
Key point is BEFORE the caretaker provision. how long before shouldn't they do things ? Politicians should understand the rules #QANDA
I work in country South Australia, I see the problems with lack of funding of mental health! #qanda
Hahahahahaha #qanda
#qanda How bizarre of Anna Burke to believe footpath-writing vegans are extremist! I didn't know they were a "thing!"
@VBLendaHand Yup. I was 5 mins behind on IQ. Robb very impressive and refreshingly frank on  a very difficult, personal issue. #QandA
Robb don't you dare try to justify this decision! Unjustifiable.  #QandA
Just because it's "not easy" doesn't mean you can sit idly by #QandA
If you can not control your booze you are not fit for a public office. #QandA
@QandA Stop telling us about social cohesion. You are preaching to the choir!! The muslim extremists' community needs to hear it!
@QandA One day at a time. Well done Andrew Robb.
That kid is speaking more maturely about issues than most politicians. #qanda
It's 2015. We shouldn't need to be saying things like this. It should be a given. RT @nickjfava People with autism are not a burden #QandA

New drinking game, every time someone on the #qanda panel mentions Tony Abbott, skull!
why are they so close together #qanda
The Liberals want more talk because it enables them to hold off spending another couple years. They worship "The Economy", not people #qanda
@Hipcrafter @QandA but we can't forget the people who are still sick and aren't at the "early intervention" or "prevention" stages.
Let's talk about how big liquor markets booze. Along with their big supermarket mates. #qanda
How about banks allowing people to get out of their depths? People suicide to escape the stigma of bankruptcy everyday #QandA
I have a problem with them being called terror raids. Let's just call them raids. #qanda
@qanda IRA were serious terrorists. #qanda
well said @dustt  I agree I saw your post on @QandA
The irony is that #qanda drives you to drink!
Is it just me or is #qanda getting whiter every week?
It's frustrating that we don't get the details of the raids. Trumped charges or dangerous folk back on the street before Anzac Day? #qanda
The west gate freeway is more often than not a capilliary rather than an arterial #qanda

Tony Abbott sculling a beer does not endear me to him. He did in in Double Bay sorrounded by rusted on Libs. #qanda

#QandA we are far in advance when dealing with depression. My partner in India has but can never admit it. Its depressing.
Dave Hughes is the most inarticulate person I've seen on #qanda
It happens at every 18th birthday party. Surely if we're going to talk about the skoll we need to talk about it there. #qanda
#QandA  We protested before the Iraq War and these outcomes of such a war were predicted then
#qanda Andrew Robb, attitudes different decades ago, we know more about alcohol now, irresponsible at best by Tony Abbott
Andrew Robb is living (fortunately) proof that mental illness is a defect in chemistry, not character.  #QandA
@Booligal @QandA Yes well said
dave hughes trying to talk about the serious issues on #qanda - possibly the funniest thing he's ever done?
@tashapotamus I hate it for exactly the same reason. What are you supposed to do with - 'no, I am not ok'. #qanda
I wish Mark Latham was on the panel talking depression #qanda
Can we please talk about something the panel knows something about? @QandA #qanda #

Well done Andrew Robb! Thanks for raising awareness about depression! A great role model. #qanda
Totally agree, 'tolerant' isn't the right word, says we're merely putting up with people instead of including them #qanda

An election was a political exercise. #qanda
Heartbreaking #qanda
A friend went to a funeral today for a 16 year old girl who committed suicide #QandA #NMHCReport
So of all the topics discussed tonight, the most impassioned speeches were about roads #facepalm #QandA
@McGlashanP #QandA Islamaphobia; a made up ism to deflect criticism &amp; discourse of Bronze Age mythology.
#QandA They go to Mosque's for the same reason Christians go to Church, they believe in GOD
#QandA has jumped the shark.
Haven 't heard Andrew Robb yet and still don't believe him #qanda
Yes @HumanHeadline we're worried about a friend. Really worried #qanda
Standard of audience questions tonight is appalling #qanda
Please come back and be our speaker Anna Burke :( #Qanda
@qanda Robb's about to blame Abbott skulling a beer on Labor!!! Bob Hawkes fault
HEAR HEAR @HumanHeadline #qanda
Small communities suffer the most from a lack of strong mental health services. #qanda
#qanda Daniel Andrew's, what a no hoping butthead. Best of luck Victoria you have always done so well under Labor.

Spent this evening finishing the @smh @dontattempt omega xword instead of #QandA now my brain hurts
Great variety of topics tonight ! Loving #qanda
The question is still confusing me. #qanda
Yeah, stigma blows, but "fixing stigma" means jack without frontline services #qanda
Andrew Robb just called it Martin Square. Ford give me strength. #qanda
If we're talking about burdens on our society, I can think of a lot more people who fit this description. #qanda
If people noticed and empathised about mental illness like they did cancer, we'd have a solution and end stigma #qanda @rubywax
A good point. Why do we wait till people are sick enough to be admitted? Why aren't we intervening earlier, often with better results #qanda
#QandA Govt policy on asylum seekers demonises the Moslem religion.
Here we go with the Abbot bashing because he drank a single beer quickly #qanda
Every Australian has the responsibility to make our country safe for disenfranchised people #qanda
Waiting all night for a panel member to burst into a rendition of Like a Prayer #qanda #mics
#qanda talking about understanding &amp; dealing with depression. Great to have organizations like @beyondblue and @EnabledEmploy helping people
Close all alcohol outlets at midnight. Just do it. #qanda
Not everyone can afford to keep a car on the road Deryn or the road tolls. More public transport is good for everyone #qanda
Tony Jones is wearing the blue tie Andrew Robb is supposed to be wearing #QandA
Ehhhh tonight's panel is so inarticulate  #qanda
Pity Steve Vizard isn't on the panel to bookend #QandA with Hinch &amp; Hunch.
Infrastructure is not built to "make" money. How much money does your street "make"? #qanda
@QandA really appreciate the frankness and honesty of the panel. Thank you! #qanda

Social cohesion and acceptance of diversity is the way forward #qanda
How about we stop marginalising and labelling people? #QandA @QandA
Immigration Dept rules only counts costs not contributions. Goes to Minister for waiver: cumbersome &amp; slow #qanda
@QandA mental illness is a choice
Andrews is building something that will make our city even more elite than it is. Takes balls if you ask me. #qanda
A lot of the mentally ill self medicate because they feel they have no help #QandA
I could disagree with Andrew Robb violently but he would never offend me as much as Dave Hughes does by being so incredibly stupid #QandA
And the stress and trauma in the meantime? Shit happens. #qanda
But we are feeding the fear with all of our hyped up media coverage. #QandA
Our government marginalises them at every opportunity and wonders why they get radicalised #qanda
The public always prefers public transport but political donors prefer oil driven transport. #qanda
Time for more respect for our mental health experts! Should be a bipartisan approach #qanda
#QandA @QandA Clean, accessible public transport available to all would be great...theory is a wonderful place, I'd like to live there
#qanda Why, as the Prime Minister of Australia, would you skull a beer in front of cameras? Who's running your PR team Tones? #badidea

You dickhead Derryn - it was TWENTY YEARS OF $400m payments per year for East West Link. Fucking bellend. #qanda
Nice tongue in cheek comment @HumanHeadline #qanda
Can Ethan run the country please??? #qanda
Someone stop Derryn Hinch talking over people #qanda
I wish we could deport politicians. They are a burden on some of the tax payers for years after their 'service'. #QandA
We voted this govt in because the EW link was a bad idea &amp; more than 50% wanted it gone, so we voted on it &amp; now they're doing it #qanda
#qanda Do something different Andrew! Stand up for Ethan.

So happy to see that we are having this conversation @qanda depression and suicide prevention #mentalillness #mentalhealth
#qanda a government that won't govern unless a war OS is involved
Looking forward to Abbott apologizing for Reclaim Australia. As head of the racist bogans, he has to condemn it. #qanda
The government is all excuses and no action when it comes to providing financial support for mental health #qanda
Public or private. Drink responsibly #qanda
#qanda play the ball not the man. Dwal with illegal activity not convenient groups or labels
@QandA will there be more funding for #mentalhealth in the Federal Budget @AndrewRobbMP? #qanda
It is a shame shame shame, crying shame that Hinch and Johnny Diesel aren't on the panel #qanda
#qanda The problem won't be solved until it is NOT courageous to talk about it.
@QandA my euro atheist parents came in the 60's, and yet I get racist comments on the street. reduce the hatred, and we reduce the radicals

Mental health is urgent. Just do what the report recommended.  #qanda
#qanda only through education can we eradicate ignorance, which is the root of all prejudice.
theres simply not enough if we still lose 7 people a day to suicide after all these years. #qanda @QandA

Tolerate traffic and bad weather. Accept and love people. #qanda
Racism destroys far more lives in Australia than, you know, Jihad. Just saying. #qanda
The only thing that Abbot did wrong, was he  didn't scull a yard glass #qanda
You are the future Ethan! Well said. #QandA
#eastwestlink Blame @denisvnapthine #rat #sideletter #auspol #qanda #springst
@juice_pre @QandA you cant DeRadicalise Allahs Army, you have soldiers n decoys ..thats Islam #auspoI
Poor Andrew Robb what a position to be in. #qanda
Those rules suck! #disability #qanda
And here comes the LNP fear campaign.  #qanda
I wish everyone would just chill, go to the beach, take a walk, play cricket #qanda
#qanda Well done humans, you have gone full circle and back to behaviour around 262BC
@qanda #qanda mental health handled by old white men = lets talk about it for ages.
We are too busy teaching 'we are all equal' rather then teaching our kids that racism exists and we do it all the time. #qanda
Its not hard to drink a lemonade at the pub #QandA
Would have liked to see Tony pour his beer into his shoe before skolling it #disappointing #qanda
#qanda I just wish everyone would grow up
It's not racist or bigoted to argue that extremists of any description be deported. It's common sense. #qanda
Disappointed no questions on the TPP #qanda
So. Many. White. People. #qanda
It is time to get of this Melbourne-centric discussion, what does it have to do with Western Sydney? #qanda
A five year old asylum seeker attempted suicide recently. Can we talk about why she would want to do that for a bit? #qanda
Lulz it's real insanity to waste 400m but not the $5B we'd loose building #eastwestlink #qanda
This government hides and delays every report they don't want to deal with. #qanda
I applaud and salute anyone publicly who stands up and de-stigmatizes mental illness #qanda
Unleash hell, Derryn @HumanHeadline. Go for it. #QandA
"It's extremism we need to knock out, not one religion or another" - thank you Anna Burke #qanda
We have to accept that some will hate us just for being who we are. All of us have to accept that. #qanda
Adopt the report, don't worry about the money. The money is not a waste, it is an investment. #qanda
Come on guys, it was one beer. Let's talk about gov. policy. #qanda
Does it have to wait for AAT decision before Minister intervenes? Why? #qanda
Andrew needs to be honest with himself and just say "i have no idea why" like he clearly wants to say #qanda
High quality Early Childhood Education needs to be recognised by the federal govt as the best form of early intervention for our chn #qanda
C'mon Hughesy, you're a comedian. Religion-bashing is one of comedy's ingredients.  #qanda
Disenfranchsation. That's what it's about. Period. #qanda
I'm not a liberal voter, but we could have a worse PM than @AndrewRobbMP #qanda
Imagine if the road toll was 2,500. That's what the suicide toll is! 7x365. #QandA
I'm Anglo. But an all Anglo panel discussing a multicultural issue is useless social science. #QandA
@AndrewRobbMP Amazing honesty and openness sharing about your journey with depression. #qanda
I've missed Anna Burke sooooooooooo much.  #QandA
Dave gets it #shoutout #blazeit #qanda
1984 called to let you know that attitudes to drinking have changed since Hawkey #qanda
The vilification of Muslims is just a consequence of the US alliance. #auspol #qanda
7 deaths a day from suicide in Australia. Horrendous. It has to be tackled and spoken about! #qanda
People in BYC catch the subway with their kids all the time #qanda
If Hughesy says anything of substance tonight I think I'm going to faint. #qanda
An autistic child is also God's son #qanda
Kids are attempting suicide younger &amp; younger. Often too young to understand "going to the doctor". How do we help them? #qanda
@QandA The lads name is Tyrone, his mum Is so worried...as local State MP I am behind him 100% ...shame abbot gov't!A Harper
what happened to all those people raided in Sydney a few months ago? Nothing.  #QandA
Yes, 300 #schoolcounsellors NSWDEC had @janeburns share these insights today. We're at the coal face &amp; on the cliff with kids. #qanda
@BowlerBarrister @QandA @LifelineAust ^^Have to think about that...have to think about your article before responding...I read it
Lots of tough issues, Alcohol abuse  &amp; Depression tonight on Q&amp;A: maybe we are not such a lucky country. #qanda
@DHughesy off to a great start! We are all humans. That's exactly it! #qanda
Andrew Robb you are CLEARLY FEARMONGERING  #qanda
Responsibility is the question not alcohol #qanda
What happened to the TPP question? #qanda
@RitaPanahi @QandA we'll take that as a comment lol
Wake up Australia! Mental health is an illness not a lifestyle choice! @QandA #QandA
You're in government, create the circumstances #QandA
oh you poor feckers have been watching #qanda again You bought your tickets.....
Since when is one beer irresponsible? #qanda
If only more men spoke about how they overcame depression!  #qanda
Yes! Anna Burke! Tolerance and acceptance are not the same thing! #QandA
Maybe the #EastWestLink shouldn't have been signed prior to the election - that's the issue #QandA
"Tolerate" is not the same as "capitulate" #qanda
#qanda Reminder Martin Bryant the Tasmanian gunmen was not a Muslim and he was not in jail Derryn!
#QandA @QandA Spare thought for the victims of Christian extremists. E.g gay couple who were harassed in country VIC &amp; abortion clinic users
It's difficult to provide a voice to the community when your mic doesn't work. #QandA
#qanda INNOVATION
Abbott showed he will cave in to peer presure   #qanda
Preventative action, then early intervention. It's cheaper and it will save more lives #QandA
I don't think radical Islam cares much about that wonderful Australian diversity you're talking about... #QandA @QandA
Hughsey just lost his greens fans #greeniesdontdrive #qanda
It's a bit sad that an eleven y/o has more insight and compassion than our government #QandA #UJCOMM2657
Reclaim Australia? ....From whom #qanda
@qanda why is it the heath and education system fault? When are people going to start taking responsibility for their own actions?
Islamaphobia responsible for faulty microphones  #qanda
Forget the airy fairy social cohesion, we tried all that, there is no hope with these #terrorist #muslims #auspol #qanda
Andrew is getting hammered tonight #qanda
Public transport is a better way of solving gridlock, not more roads. #qanda
Interesting man is Andrew Robb. Totally willing to accept psychiatric advise,unwilling to accept scientific advise on climate #auspol #qanda
@LaLegale @MargMcCrohon @QandA catch 22!!
Abbott's skol was just another stunt. #qanda @qanda
So @DHughesy drinks heavily and smokes pot - and its the alcohol to blame...... #qanda
#qanda or  cover rail lines with tar dirt and grass - seriously stupid..to kill infrastructure before you replace it...
#qanda @QandA depression effects people in different ways.. More help needs to be provided
So @QandA starts with something quite evidently NOT a question...
The Recital Centre might be the most appropriate place for #qanda ever.
Anna Burke will you please send Derryn Hinch off the #qanda panel under 94A
Oh Robb is worried about 700 jobs while his Gov were happy to loose thousands in  a manufacturing #qanda
Drugs &amp; Mental Health have a considerable amount of cross over. And both should be treated the same way. As health issues. #qanda
"Ice is destroying a generation" @HumanHeadline thinks drug addiction is making the future frightening #QandA http://t.co/nalAMq04X3
Too many people think depression is a sign of a weakness. We need more education. #qanda
Let's not forget the work of the Vietnam Veterans and what they have done #QandA
Please stop protesting on @QandA. You're questions aren't more important than anyone elses', don't think yourself special.
#qanda Individuals in personal vehicles, good; masses dependent on government transportation, bad!
The QansA logo looks like the Avengers logo #qanda
Mmmm...London Underground and Melbourne Rail Network are so alike... said no Melbournian ever! #qanda
@QandA stop calling it 'Muslim extremism' they are just extremists and no different to the catholic pedophiles, they trade in fear #qanda
I wish Australia would adopt a more healthful approach to counselling/psychotherapy: get help *before* things get insurmountable. #qanda
#qanda the love for Robb dried up pretty quick when it came to talk of funding
You can't question their endeavour #qanda
When does the audience put on hand knitted balaclavas and start swinging signs? #qanda
Unless you know ALL the details, you can hardly pass judgment on bail and charging decisions. #qanda
@ResStretton I've read some! I also like a lot of Aggleton's work. But I'm curious about how ppl use "stigma" in general, like on qanda too
But but Tony Abbott doesn't believe in "soft" causes like preventative mental health funding #qanda
The East-West Link is a dud project, signed off by a desperate government. #qanda
Napthine had no mandate to build the road and Andrews has the mandate to not build.  #qanda
Multiculturalism is great, as long as everyone is the same. #qanda
ABC's defamation lawyers working overtime tonight for #QandA
@QandA liberal bias in qanda land
But what about people with a mental health issue NOW  #qanda
I am PROUD to say I am a "patient" of @headspace_aus and they are AMAZING!!! There needs to be WAY more centres though! #QandA
#qanda oh shut up Derryn -Gaol -everyone
#QandA Anna Bourke's solution sounds a lot like sitting in a circle and singing kumbaya
Simply blaming everyone else is not the answer. #qanda
Terrorism is a Mental illness.  #QandA
I still think Hawke has one over Abbott in the beer drinking! #qanda
@qanda Jnae doing well on mental health stuff...shame we can't call it mental wellness not illness
Middle East complaining about sovereign risk to Robb? Fair Dinkum, Cobber! #qanda
Mental illness is such an important topic to be discussing, glad #qanda is dedicating time to discussing it #ujcomm2657
@QandA great issue but you don't have a Muslim spokesperson on the panel. Surely it's essential
It's been downhill for Mr Robb after a promising start #QandA
I've said it before, I'll say it again, Anna Burke would have been a great frontbencher. Unfortunately too much of a straight talker. #qanda
Boozers are losers #qanda
I see lotsa people with 3-4 kids on public transport all the time @QandA
@NDISyesADHCyes @QandA he always has his own agenda, doesn't he?
@McKimFFK Probably anti-TPP. Jones was disgraceful not discussing it. @qanda #qanda
this woman should be in charge of running parliament, or something #qanda
#qanda Mental illness is a lifestyle choice, isn't it?
Hughsie dealt with depression by stopping drinking  #QandA
mental healthcare needs to be more available to EVERYONE. Not just those that can afford it privately #qanda
We have a serious #drinking problem but nothing will be done about it  #qanda
@QandA I have higher expectations of a Prime Minister. @qanda
I haven't got a TV right now so I can't watch Q&amp;A but if Twitter is anything to go by, Derryn Hinch hasn't mentioned fibre once. #qanda
Doesn't look like #QandA are going to get to the protester's question.
It's Labor's fault ! Andrew Robb #QandA #quanda
I think the microphones on #qanda are responding poorly to all the high-pitched dog-whistling.
That is "their" problem that "they" should fix. Vom. #qanda
Andrew Robb, not only breaking down barriers to trade, but also barriers to the stigma of mental illness. What a man. #qanda
The attitude of  governments globally towards people has become heartless no compassion no empathy people feel lost. #auspol #qanda
Tired, crabby, and I ate crackers for dinner. But #QandA is on my telly. All is right in my world.
@QandA this issue is everywhere throwing people off refuge boats because they are Christian says a lot about the muslim religion.
Has Andrew talked to Peta Credlin before coming on tonight. He is off message. #qanda
#QandA Great to hear Andrew Robb talking directly about using medications to treat depression effectively
Minute government is going backwards in the polls, out comes the #terror card #qanda
#BoganRule #qanda  https://t.co/ZBWRw1s0nE
Imagine if the Fed Gov determined that the NBN FTTH infrastructure was needed despite policy commitments #qanda
Derryn. Shush with the talking over. #qanda
Men need to get help when depressed, remaining quiet only delays the day when the sun shines again! #qanda
Great work on #QandA tonight @janeburns - especially through sound problems!
i went to the toilet, are they still talking about roads #qanda
Pity mental health isn't taken more seriously. #qanda
I would rather stop all stations on a train than drive on Melbourne freeways #QandA
#qanda the sector is bigger than #mentalhealth and is united and ready @janeburns @yawcrc
Public transport isn't great.  Takes about 2 hours from Epping to Brookevale. 35 mins in a car. I wonder which I will choose! #qanda
Flicked onto #qanda What a load of dribble &amp; waffle. Disproportionate time on topics of small consequence
well said @DHughesy we are all human #qanda
will I ever kiss a girl?? #QandA
The way mental health services operate at the moment, your best bet is to avoid having a mental illness outside a capital city. #qanda
First time tweeter long time follower, This is riveting viewing #qanda
7 suicides a day and we are arguing about a road... #qanda
@QandA #qanda "litmus test" well said Anna Bourke. Everybody should live in Aust, under our constitution.
"two parties playing chicken and it's cost us 500 million" #qanda
Why are we surprised about this? We have many children in prison in our name! #qanda
#qanda not everyone has Jeff Kennett as a mate
#qanda I'm pretty sure Andrews has done what he said he would do
My @qanda review:
#qanda Please make sure it's the #AbTSI experts guiding the #AbTSI #NMHCReport key responses. We want people to get the services they need.
#NSOHelpline #QandA http://t.co/rn3v9fAYv4
Radicalism is overcome by hope, employment and a sense of achievement #qanda
Get this man a shovel #qanda
Accessing affordable, effectual and professional Mental Health services is the issue that needs to be addressed #qanda
Muslims have to take a litmus test!? How about white people take a litmus test "are you racist?" #qanda
Also I hate the word skoll. #qanda
Tony Abbott is a mad keen drinker. Loves a drink, plenty of drunken policies too. #qanda
Just waiting to hear the 'they're just naughty boys' line. If you're  fucking up, you're fucking up. If you're not, no probs #Qanda
How come Italians, Greeks, Germans, etc intergrated in Australia but Muslims don't?? #qanda
I don't care. And I don't drink. #qanda
Very candid discussion tonight on @QandA, so important to begin breaking the taboos surrounding mental health #QandA #ujcomm2657
Education is always the answer! #qanda
No he hasn't. Your Gov. Has by all your Lying.  #qanda
Mental illness is not a lifestyle choice. Neither is the poverty &amp; homelessness to many are stuck in. #qanda
Victorians will pay on all current freeways that aren't tolled if the East West link was Built #QandA
Question is not about Hawke but about Abbott. Answer the question. #QandA
How can you try and defend this decision! This needs to be overruled  #qanda
The fact you still can't adopt a child if you have a history of mental illness. #qanda #ujcomm2657
When you control the children you control culture and the future.  http://t.co/bjEbycEaY0 #Auspol #Politas #QandA http://t.co/rLIz76hdgn
Meanwhile, in the rest of the country... #qanda
.@tanya_plibersek on #qanda next week!
It's depressing to hear how mental illness is still stigmatised #qanda
Suicide is a cry for help that no one hears #qanda
If 7 people a day are commuting suicide due to a lack of care for mental illness we have our priorities skewed. Time for change #qanda
@firefly_rfs: @QandA how do you make people feel welcome when they are fully covered - burqa hijab, their religion doesn't allow it #qanda
Leading cause of death among men under 45 is suicide. Not cars, not alcohol; suicide #QandA
Sounds like the audio department is experiencing the effects of the budget cuts. Lots of issues tonight. #qanda
He had one beer. Seriously get over it #qanda
I sneeze when I look at bright lights as well #qanda
Race to the bottom. What happened to ethics in Australia? #qanda
What an honest answer @qanda
#qanda Please don't ask Dave Hughes for any contribution to tonight's discussion! #winstonchurchillwasanass #anzacday
#qanda Chaplin services really? Religion should STAY OUT OF schools, a fake deity false gods, from "god" jesus &amp; allah
Irresponsible drinking? He chugged one beer. Log off. #qanda @QandA
Wild conspiracy theories from Mr Robb!  #qanda
Ministerial discretion - if you can get on #qanda
fuck off wowser #qanda
1 in 5 - we are all impacted by mental illness. #qanda
Apparently flying cars will be available in Australia next year, anyway. #qanda
Ok let's talk about WHY people are depressed? What's the root of the problem? #QandA #suicide #mentalhealth
Building more roads to solve traffic congestion is like loosening your belt to solve an obesity crisis #qanda
Anna Burke MP killing it. She knows her stuff. Shut up, haters. #qanda
Ice a terrible drug. Ironically it's local knowledge. Time for local action. #qanda
It is not 'hard to go to the pub and not drink'.  Not at all.  Grow a spine.  #qanda
I'm drinking a tasty beer right now #qanda
@demon_dave @fedupofpollys #QANDA As do some Jews who think its OK to take over all of Palestine!
#qanda @QandA Anna Burke dancing to muslims vote bank. lol
@SivParker @safzoro I'm watching #qanda. #sadist
#QandA So true. The people with most genuine reason to be fearful on the streets are hijab-wearing women
Better public transport such as #DoncasterRail down the Eastern Fwy would reduce traffic congestion, freeing up road space #qanda
Mental health consumers also made submissions to the review !! #qanda
Well, yeah. Unpleasant behaviour breeds unpleasant behaviour #QandA
cmon guys, lets keep this civil ! everyone is perfect in gods eyes ! #qanda @QandA
@QandA #QandA @TonyAbbottMHR Drinker or wanker?
Binge drinking can lead to depression #qanda
Tonight's #qanda appears to be a 'had to be there' event.
OK Q and A you're starting to sound like breakfast TV!! One at a time please #qanda
if ypou know the name of your dark passenger then you can begin to fight it #QandA
If cannabis was legal we probably would not have any ice issues. Get the giggles instead of the shakes. #qanda
Dave has a good point, life is for enjoying, let's make the most of this life, because we don't know what's after it! #qanda
Legalise Marijuana, Tax goon.  Save money in hospitals! Simple! #QandA #AusPol
The support is there. You just have to dig to find the appropriate support. #qanda
I... I'm not sure we all have the same DNA, Dave. #qanda
#qanda this is why we are taking this approach with students: https://t.co/S0cEv86h4i
Bob Hawke is famous for sculling numerous beers. Yet Tony Abbott can't scull one?? #ujcomm2657 #qanda
You will be shocked to know even non psychiatric doctors have stigma towards psychiatric patients    Raiz ISMAIL #qanda
Drink responsibly. That's all. #qanda
Perhaps we could have a War on depression and kill all the depressed people. Isn't that how these wars go?? #QandA
Wow ok Darren. #qanda
Ssshhhh! #qanda
@QandA Isn't the government campaigning to change our drinking culture? What are those educational ads about? #qanda
I find it odd that there have been no charges laid #qanda
Worth noting, that it's not long ago that depression wasn't considered an illness. Just an emotional state #qanda http://t.co/DdlQFhZWnG
Mind over body #qanda
Isn't there an unconscious bias in an all white panel #qanda
Shotgun last tweet #qanda @QandA
Restless audience for #qanda tonight.
Derryn they were released because they had no evidence on them #qanda
@QandA we need faster access to mental health services especially for young people when they need help!!! 1 month wait !! Not good enough!
Cost benefit ratio of #EWLink = 0.45. That's a 55c lost for every dollar. @albomp #qanda
@QandA @HumanHeadline @janeburns Good on you Hughsie.  Your right, the toughest guy is the one who says NO.
How amazing would it have been if @TonyAbbottMHR had said 'no thanks, I'll be right.' #qanda
More people need to talk openly about their experience with depression so others are encouraged not to suffer silently #QandA #UJcomm2657
#QandA RIOT in the studio!!! Loving @QandA
Ban alcohol sponsorship of sport -  #QandA
Much more fun that #qanda - Putin seriously suggested Steven Seagal as a Kremlin-Whitehouse intermediary. #youvegottobekidding #chokepoop
#QandA Clearly what we don't need in Mental Health Services is The Governement.  They should butt out and let us get on with it.
Swiss train officials freak out if the train is over thirty seconds late. Let's all move #qanda
Meanwhile football fans and players think it's ok to take shots at Mitch Clark for his mental illness #qanda
#QandA for goodness sake leave religion alone. All of us need to just accept we are all different in our ways and beliefs
Watch Robb divide &amp; conquer: LNP policy. #qanda
Where's the music? #qanda
@BastianSimrajh @SallyRMelb Disagree. #qanda is about freedom of speech and national debate. However repugnant, it is a view held.
Looks like a sore point has been touched #qanda
Islamic leaders have been speaking out for ages. Not their fault people ignore them/ dismiss it claiming they're misleading everyone. #qanda
Melbournians have been very restless for a bit of #QandA focus!
So Jones will be like "run out of time, no time for #TPPA Qs #qanda
The Federal Government has increased funding for programs at schools &amp; in suburbs where there are high % Muslim students #qanda
#qanda. Yeah.  Let's separate boozing with our notion of manhood &amp; nationality.
How often do Aussie Muslims have to denounce what others do in other countries? Can the questioner give us a number? #qanda @qanda

Why can't you take kids on a train? #qanda
@QandA The question remains; where is the line between beheading infidels or not? The local Imams are failing to clarify
We absolutely need more community health services, but we can't ignore the crucial roles hospitals play. Increasing fund all over! #QandA
Touchy topic #qanda @QandA
#qanda bloody hell Hinch. That was 1972
Drinking may cost us alot, but it also provides great opportunities to socialise, enjoy life and be fun. But still boundaries exist #qanda
Stigmas don't just disappear; hard work is required to change society's attitudes. #QandA
#qanda if the world was totally Islam there would still be radical violent men committing crime in the name of their religion.

@QandA Do we need to come terms with the possibility that some religions  ideologically oppose fostering  connection with nonbelievers?
Oh please @AndrewRobbMP. #whereisthelove #qanda
This is bizarrely fascinating. Trying to physically create a release of endorphins to combat depression. #qanda
@QandA this is criminal
We need to educate people on what some of these faiths actually believe. Instead of the bits &amp; pieces the media choose to focus on. #qanda
Disappointed Ray Hadley hasn't had a #qanda gig yet
Religion poisons everything #QandA
#qanda The problem is religious education. Correct it. Make it JUST education...no god worship required.

Geez, it's getting so you can't even demonise a whole culture without some of them getting all radicalised. #qanda

#qanda Mental Health is the most pressing medical issue in the community and its a shame it doesn't get enough acknowledgement
Ask Tony #qanda
Perfectly summed up. Mental illness is not a choice. #qanda
#qanda so if a politician says I want that off @QandA comments, it's off !
Sharing the same DNA Dave?  #qanda

How about we just make all Australians take a litmus test: Do you support bad stuff? #Qanda

Ice and drug use are an issue, but chances are the decision to use them is born of mental illness or some other factor such as abuse. #qanda

What a great way to perpetuate the 'Aussie bloke' stereo type. #qanda
Look at America compared to Europe. Motorays Freeways are a disaster Public Transport is the future. @QandA #qanda
Send them more Chaplin's!!! @QandA
RT: @GetUp The mental health report found more people die by their own hand than are killed in road accidents or by skin cancer. #qanda
Amazing. It's my exact ultimate dinner party guest list. #Qanda
Better rail equals better freight management and transport systems #QandA
Can we ask WHY.. When we know why. Then try and fix that, ppl need kindness help and understanding. Not just reports.  #qanda
Just ban religion.That is all. #qanda
I'm doing the "smile when you wake up" thing to combat low mood at the mo and it's a corker. Unstoppable laughter without fail. #qanda
Robb is negotiating and signing treaties on our behalf, how scary is that  #QandA
That was a desperate act for popularity from abbot chugging that beer - very staged  #QandA
#qanda Good on you kiddo but isn't it past bedtime? haha
In Dolphins? #qanda
Talking about mental illness is a great step towards challenging stigma. Lets talk about it! #qanda
#qanda Andrew Robb you cannot justify this.
Never forget Robb introduced the very racist "Australian Citizenship" test. #qanda
I guarantee that investment won't be affected. #qanda
Preach it Hughesy #qanda
Was not aware Andrew Robb suffered from depression. A lot of respect for the way he came back #qanda
An election isn't a single issue referendum #qanda
#QandA We need leadership which promotes strong humanitarian values and not constant fear!
Deporting a 10 year old kid because he has autism. New low. @ABCTV #qanda
Skol skol skol skol skol #qanda
Is #qanda hole on?
Onions and beer aside, young Australians still don't like Tony Abbott. #qanda
Isn't that just the question! Why can't we just get along? #qanda
Man of the people Tony Abbott skulls a beer with Prince Phillip #qanda
Answer the question don't state your agenda #QandA
@QandA Abbott is no Hawke!
@QandA I don't think there is as much fear as you think. Just the ones who are, are the loudest due to their ignorance
Loves me a Monday night #qanda sesh.
#QandA Tired of inner city dwellers saying take public transport, when MOST outer &amp; growth corridors in Oz have virtually none!
Hughesy on #qanda tonight has me excited.
LOL is this a cool egg or what! And that Albatross will wander the Ocean for years  hardly ever seeing land #qanda https://t.co/gwsigvULSI
Ice...the real terrorism #qanda
@N_____d1 No.  I'm not quite used to that. #qanda
I love that Aussies can call each other wankers on TV and both parties are laughing.. oh and all on #qanda !
There will be a monthly terror raid up until the next election, with trumped up charges. Guaranteed. #qanda
Dave Hughes, articulate as ever. #QandA
Australia is so ridiculously sensitive about drinking. That's the problem. #qanda
Just ask Tony. #qanda
We've lost our way. #qanda
Bring back the horse and buggy #qanda
There is still not enough support for mental illness sufferers, that is unless you can afford a private clinic #qanda
Some workplaces say the right buzz words but have no idea how to handle staff members with mental illnesses. #qanda
I'm not sure I like this new blonde lady host of #qanda
Hey onion breath are you watching this?  #QandA
We are so harsh on others around us, we don't hesitate to label people stupid or lazy. No wonder we don't speak up when depressed. #QandA
#OzEarlyEd folk, who is watching #QandA tonight?
What do we think of tony...he's alright..he's got a small dick but he's alright #qanda
Andrew Robb has the personality of a wet sock #qanda
#qanda I wish we could spend as much time and money on the problem of violence against women.
He wasn't in the prime ministership when he did it Andrew Robb... #QandA
It's such a shame that we have this culture where drinking and drunk is seen as more acceptable than not drinking at all #QandA
#qanda Perhaps LNP shouldn't have signef contracts.
Presto, Netflix, Stan and still Monday equals everyone shitting on #qanda
Essential to ensure cheaper/free mental health services, if we get them, don't descend into churn-through megaclinic model. #qanda
I'm never sure about Tony's ascertain's #qanda
Isalamphobia is a term made up by C.A.I.R. to shutdown any debate on problems with Muslims. #qanda
I love roads. Don't you love roads? Roads are lovely. #qanda
#qanda more alarmism..don't build a toll road and we destroy the entire country it seems
Well said Darren - lock them away without trial - thats the Australian way #QandA
Not many people understand mental health unless they have it or live with someone who has it. #qanda
Andrew Robb, why are you selling our SOVEREIGNTY via # TPP.  @QandA #Qanda
#QandA Thousands of deaths by suicide in Australia; virtually none by terrorism. What do we focus on... ?
Was curious to witness the bile in that questioner on a litmus test #qanda
Imagine politicians being honest about their mandate, winning and then doing what they said? #QandA
How can Anna Burke say half the community when Muslims supposedly only make up less than 2%? Does she need a lesson in maths? #qanda
We all enjoy getting steamed #qanda
There is nothing worse than cutting your best friend down from a tree #qanda
That will never happen because there is big money in people's addictions. We're no Angels. #qanda
Mental health needs to be made aware and discussed in high school forums #qanda
Suicide breaks my heart, every time  #qanda
It's like someone turns a light on when the meds kick in. #qanda
For once I agree with Andrew Robb - can we just get over Abbott and the beer? #qanda
@QandA We still play lip service with depression &amp; revert to type. Just look at the way the Germanwings co-pilot has been labelled. #qanda
"Yeah. Mmmm. I don't know." Is probably the most refreshingly honest answer #qanda has ever had..
#QandA Crap !! Regardless how drunk one is! One still remembers everything ! Stop fooling your selves !!
Let's talk about ALL. The American women coming here to have the baby's. I think they are abusing our health care #qanda
I love that Hughsey just said 'wanker' on #qanda
If someone were diabetic, we wouldn't query their capacity to work. Why do we do this for mental illness? #qanda
Dave Hughes, let the sun shine in. #qanda
@Omer_Incekara Depression is form of mental illness. Mental illness is a disease. #QandA
That's why we need trained counsellors not chaplains at schools #qanda
We should talk about mental illnesses like any other illness- openly and without judgement. #qanda
How to find these disconnected Muslims is the problem #qanda
Imagine if we spent as much worry and effort on wife-bashers as we do on terrorists. #QandA
Anybody that doesn't believe that there is no racism present in Australia is having themselves on #QandA
Just like George Pell should've spoken up? #qanda
#qanda Delay the mental health issue just so they can use it at election time
#qanda Are the racist Australians prepared to take the litmus test?
The squeaky wheel might get the most attention but what about asylum seeker children? #qanda
Alcoholism fuels suicide too, not just ice #qanda
When Rudd was PM, @TonyAbbottMHR hated talkfests and wanted action. Now all he wants is talkfests #qanda
We actually talk about this quite a lot, maybe it's time to act on this report rather than review the review #QandA 7 deaths a day!!
I don't agree with his politics but Andrew's discussion about depression is inspiring #QandA
I wish I cared about anything as much as Melbournians care about roads #qanda
@QandA binge drinking has been present in every generation. Is folly to think otherwise.
Listen to this bullshit stumbling around to justify. #qanda
#Qanda PM is a dribbler not a skol'er
@Spoonyman Take a look around. That's the majority, 'radicalised' in one way or another, for one cause or another. #qanda
Some bosses sack employes that say they have depression #qanda
When in doubt criticise the unions... #qanda #classiclibs
Dave Hughes with insight I never knew.  We are all the  same.  Hmmm no we are not.  #qanda
Hinch should speak out more against extremist old white men #QandA
It is about national leadership and regional responses to mental health and suicide prevention #qanda #NMHCReport
Crime... Boy, I don't know... #thewestwing #meets #qanda @qanda
Not sure what it is about Melbourne but it is ground zero for ABC panels for those wanting to be chief warden of the Nanny State #qanda
Don't need East-Westlink as 'poor people don't drive' #QandA
#QandA, we might want to tackle real radicals but I can strongly recommend embracing radical reels (adventure films):
I'm more of a veganaphobe than anything else. #qanda
Wow. Shouting over a female panellist. Who would have thought. #qanda
wait I misread this #qanda
which is more important? mental balance? or balanced budget? #qanda
Sorry, there was no clearer election mandate than the East-West Link. #QandA
It is not human nature, it is enculturation #qanda
Please turn her mike off again #QandA
Another example of ABC extravagance? #QandA in Melbourne just because it's raining in Sydney.
Is Rita Panahi a real person? #qanda
#qanda every case has merits
@QandA really honest man on national TV rare!
#qanda Andrew Robb living in the past
Breaking through the wall of stigma! @AndrewRobbMP #mentalhealth #qanda
As a new father of a 3 week old, I am truly worried about her future and safety in Australia. Are we really that safe here? #qanda
@QandA @HumanHeadline Derryn buying into the media hype
So many plants. #qanda
Dave wat r u sayin #qanda
Robb's comments don't seem... helpful. #qanda
#qanda When you can't deliver on a recommendation just fund another report, stall for time and hope that someone else fixes the problem.
Anna Bourke-one of my all time fav, composed high profile woman #QandA
Never watch #QandA any more. Just read on Twitter and write my own narrative.
#qanda Didn't take long fo Jones &amp; Co to get onto bagging TA for having a beer. What a pack of hypocrites
What's wrong with these Victorians #qanda
I think the government thinks the market can take care of ice along with everything else #qanda
I truly hope Robb uses his story to urge colleagues to properly fund mental health initiatives - a big issue and isn't gender defined #qanda
"what boys do"... and lots of girls. Seems odd someone with a boys do this and girls do that attitude was once heading Beyond Blue. #QandA
Also on #qanda we talk about white people with white people.
#ABC #qanda We are not racist , &amp; don't tell us we are .
We must set a tone for #mentalhealth reform that says everything is on the table and we are ready to act. People are relying on us! #qanda
After the Haneef debacle every terrorism raid is underwhelming at best #qanda
Maybe we could stop killing people in the countries of their ancestors?  Would that help?  #QandA
So it seems Tony Jones may have been telling a bit of a porky to that person protesting about the TPP. No question asked about it. #qanda
I wish more people would admit it was medication that helped @qanda
.@stephrice88 Diabolical that he is the Minister for Women. What has he done in that portfolio apart from closing refuges? #qanda
all I wanted from tonight's panel was the 'legalizing marijuana' debate. #420 #qanda
Suicide is tragic. You can only do so much. Mental health services need to improve but it won't totally remove the problem. #qanda
There is no compensation. #qanda
Looking for a beard on #qanda - that's my brother!
Teach resiliency in schools. That's be a good step, you'd think. @QandA
apparently we're in a state of fear? the tv told me so #qanda
Why not bring alcohol laws into line with cannabis - and provide legal alcohol only to people too sick to enjoy it? #qanda @qanda
It sounds horrifying because it IS! #QandA
"We're all gonna die" Say it how it is, #Hughsy - #qanda
#qanda "You're not special"? Hughesy's just stolen from another comedian: http://t.co/FJaEutpOeC
#qanda mo!
Chaplains in schools aren't helpful when we need COUNSELLORS! #qanda
Make public transport so efficient that its the best option. Public transport is the future. #qanda #qanda
The idea that alcohol is linked to youth culture in Australia is worrying. Alcohol is so damaging to our society. #qanda
Islamophobia creates radical Muslims #qanda
Infrastructure investment is a key investment to economic growth #qanda
The good fish Australia rots from the head. #qanda
#qanda Andrew Robb trying to defend his colleague, looking sad
Also Dave Hughes is fucken teetotal you idiot #qanda
All this talk on mental health is great but the time for action is overdue. We need to do better. #qanda
#qanda @QandA i am not surprised Anna's kid said that,
Well durr @DHughesy, shush already #qanda
Fear and xenophobia wins elections in Australia. It's no longer the hip pocket nerve. #qanda
BCR of 0.45 #qanda
A local member who knows and fights for her constituents! Go Anna Burke! #qanda
Nice to see the majority understand how bad that road was. #qanda
#qanda citizenship should be probationary so serious criminals including terrorists can be deported. @qanda
Stop glamourising alcohol #qanda
Omg. @janeburns. Killin' it. #QandA
Warney was actually a commercial for beer, no one noticed #qanda
Another swipe at Muslims at a whole. #QandA
Unless the law is changed there cant be a happy ending tbf #qanda
Those ISIL bastards really need a beer #qanda
The electorate is ultimately more important than the finance sector. #qanda
Perhaps the ministers for education, science and women will work together to make Aus a more enlightened place to live. #qanda
@qanda Andrew Robb said imams failed to take responsibility for the Cronulla riots. Blaming the victims. #qanda
#qanda We are bringing trouble on our selves by Invading @ 17.000 kms away !! Lets worry about our own back yard !!
This will be a test of the humanity of the minister #QandA
"In Australia we see excellence in suicide prevention but mostly in isolation." http://t.co/dqqAKvXH7K #NMHCReport #qanda #suicideprevention
Real athletes don't drink to excess. #qanda

@jaeleaskehan @QandA bravo for pulling them up on this!
Getting to Melbourne on time from Geelong on a V/Line is a bit of a novelty. That is so wrong! #qanda
I catch the tram. It makes me happy. #qanda
@joza2006 We will ask the Poms nicely and send him back by boat. #QandA
Don't forget that depression is outweighed by people who suffer anxiety. Equally debilitating. #qanda
Good lineup tonight. #QandA
Funny how it takes a Darwin kid (one who actually meets refugee kids) to raise a question that reveals a major flaw in policy. #QandA
#QandA While on subject of #EWlink debacle: the LNP committed #sABBOTTage with intent &amp; should therefore be responsible for bills! #AUSpol
Most suicide attempts are help calls, first step, look around us #UJComm2657 #qanda
Need to address radcalisation holistically, starts with the families not leaders. #qanda
#qanda there will always be disassociated youth and there will always be older opportunistic people seducing them to use for their own end
Anna Bourke making a lot of sense #qanda
And not to mention the children who we're causing mental and physical harm to through government-sanctioned punishment. #QandA
#qanda Change the rules then. FFS!
im not watching #qanda so I don't know what this is about but im just popping in to declare that no, I am the toughest guy in the bar
#qanda I'm thirsty
A litmus test is for acid and alkali, not human opinions, mate #qanda
ISIS are a criminal syndicate who prey on the weak and vulnerable in our society. #qanda
You know a debate has lost its way when we move onto the "shoulds" required of others #qanda
@OrinRezwana The quote is from one of the #qanda panelists, for context.
Couldn't the police have knocked instead of bursting in? #qanda
Andrew Robb s government is not interested in the deradicalisation of muslims.  It'll take leaders to do that. #qanda @QandA
Shush #qanda audience member. Get a Twitter account. It's much more effective.
So what happened to the TPP question, Tony? #qanda
Mental illness does not discriminate. It affects people of all ages and all socioeconomic groups. #qanda
Vegan are basically just like jihadists with their chalk and their beheadings except for the beheadings. #qanda
Abbott is punishing Victoria for not voting for his party. #qanda
So people who sell oil are unhappy we aren't building roads? Shocking. #qanda
#qanda it's great that a man of this stature in the government can tell his story about depression.
Coal face works. Centralisation just robs funds for overhead. #qanda
#QandA Andrew Rob is just prevaricating
Why should we get over our PM making a fool of himself and our county? #qanda
nobody cares if you are happy to pay tax or not #qanda
what are we actually talking about here other than 'mental health is important and we should tackle it' #qanda
Home litmus test kits stocks have just gone up #qanda
Anyone who doesn't think Tony Abbott and his inner circle won't make a shitload from fucking Australia over the TPP is a fool. #qanda
Being a bartender persuaded my daughter to stop drinking. "Drunks are boring" #QandA
@QandA a litmus test? That's an extremist view... #qanda
Domestic violence, growing inequality, shrinking media, ageing population, climate change. So let's talk about Warnie's drinking. #qanda
Hold on, Anna Burke almost said something sensible. #qanda
Is ISIS talking social cohesion in Iraq and Syria #qanda
Person centred care.  Not sure I have heard that on  @qanda before! Thanks @janeburns #qanda
I'm confused. I thought "drinking culture" had something to do with Yakult. #QandA
Coles to sponsor Tony Abbott's drinking. Down, down, scooners are down #qanda
He's PM, he should be thinking about the camera's. There's no way he didn't know #QandA
The media have fed the fear #qanda
Such personal, refreshing, powerful conversation @QandA @DHughesy
It isn't just young people who kill themselves. We need to look at all walks of life. #qanda
Calm down and have a beer #qanda
What about high speed rail for the East Coast? #qanda
@AAuzzieGamer @sussanley @qanda If we had no Medicare,we could let em in,but SocializedHealthCareSys is magnet for sick,disabled &amp; retarded!
Crumbs, we are all in trouble if the original owners try to reclaim Australia.  #qanda
@QandA Great to hear more about mental health in Australia, it's usually too quiet
Let's spend $4 million on a anti climate change nutter and deport a 10 year old autistic kid. Well done the liberal party. #qanda
Finally a mental health question, and an excellent one at that #qanda
When Tony Jones looks at Andrew Robb he is seeing what he will look like in ten years time. #qanda
Melbourne obviously incredibly racist #qanda
What about people with mental illness who don't have supportive family and access to quality mental health services? #qanda
Working together in partnership to overcome the challenge of stigma, talking about our own lived experiences #mentalhealth #qanda @janeburns
Andrew Robb "Leave Tony alone! Every one always picks on Tony!" #QandA
How did this 'global problem' come about? #QandA
Melbourne in a state of Anarchy!!!!! #firstworldproblems #qanda
None of the "terror suspects" was charged, because they had no evidence. #qanda
@DHughesy is equal parts wit and humour, and equal parts inspiring and insightful #QandA
PC Police are out in force. #qanda
#QandA Life in Australia has become very depressing for most Australians. Oz, was a place of opportunity, now it's a place for opportunists.
How about just answering the questions #qanda
#qanda The Andrews govt kept its promise, a refreshing and welcome change
#qanda just made me depressed
@demon_dave We will not let them send these people back. #QandA
Australia - you have just hit peak mean #qanda
Government must STOP STALLING on mental health reform! #BetterAccess now! #QandA @QandA
Say, "No!" to TPP. No more Unequal Treaties. #QandA
Why is depression something to be ashamed of? Especially in men? @QandA #qanda
'hey I know, let's assume islam is administered the same as christianity and go from there' #qanda
It seems untreated depression carries the stigma but we celebrate those who manage it #QandA
Social connectedness and more youth engagement support #qanda
Lizard people can drink pretty quickly #qanda
#qanda great question on depression....

Australia discussing alcohol is like a reformed drunk arguing with themself.   #QandA Polarity isn't reality.
#qanda Isn't it quaint when politicians talk about long commutes while they fly around on private planes and chauffeured cars.
Fund counsellors not religious chaplains. #qanda
Hey @qanda - next time panelists have to talk about suicide can you give them tips on language #qanda http://t.co/4EUF2ZsGoX
Why can't we have both? Rail and road? #QandA @QandA
Mental illness is like cancer or heart disease or gall stone. #qanda
HECKLERS! #qanda
@DHughesy is doing an amazing job on #qanda tonight!
Tony Jones claims that Bob Hawke wasn't drinking when he was Prime Minister... he cannot be serious! #QandA
#qanda but poor people don't drive - ??
All this government shelving review after review is causing a bit of mental stress in itself #QandA
@gaelia47 Yep. Australians cannot "respect" a religion that is against democracy, women, freedom and any other religion. #qanda #auspol
I'd need to scull a lot more than one beer to consider @DHughesy a 'comedian'. #QandA
Thanks for letting me in the audience, #qanda. NOT.
Absolutely disgusting, stop treating disabilities as a burden and start accepting them, their still human #qanda
There's been a heightened level of tension because the Abbott government has orchestrated a higher level of tension #QandA
Awesome, @QandA #qanda has the treasonous @AndrewRobbMP who has sold out Oz on the disgusting anti-Australian TPP #whataturnoff
@QandA that's just f'd change the rules
Robb is concerned about an ideology corrupting young boys &amp; hiding behind religion. Is he talking about Islam or the Catholic Church #QandA
I don't enjoy #QandA as much since the on-screen tweets changed from discussion-starters to flimsily-veiled hate speech.
Tony Abbott - the skol that stupefied a nation. #qanda
Yay #qanda is not on daylight savings time any more. Looking for #TPP answers from Robb.
#qanda the PM is too old to be acting like a hoon
. @qanda #qanda please ask @AndrewRobbMP why Malaysia gets text of TPP and Australians don't? What's he hiding? #corporatekleptocracy
Stigma won't go away without a shift in culture, need more education and open discussion in society about mental health  #qanda
Can't remember that guy's name but he was a spunk #qanda @QandA
#Qanda so Anna Bligh is not being a drinker being an extremist like vegans are extremists?
Robb cites ASIO spooks monitoring people as proof of guilt. Not so long ago the spooks monitored unionists &amp; peace activists #qanda
Andrew Robb on QandA. The 2nd most honest account of depression I've ever heard @Hammo46
The community is at a level of fear because people like Andrew Robb tells the community to be scared. #qanda
Andrew Robb is a great example of how people can carry on and cope through mental illness. So valuable. #qanda
Infrastructure debate...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz #QandA #AusPol
Hughesy doesn't drink #qanda

Wow what a really good question #QandA
#qanda VERY VERY Dangerous concept... 'Knocking out extremism '...
How do we stop questioners from posing comments as question?? #qanda
Can we please come back to Melbourne next week #unfinishedbusiness #qanda
I might not agree with his party but Im proud to see Andrew Robb talking about his personal mental health experiences #smashthestigma #qanda
Good the AFL did that... Now what about all the other organisations in Australia #QandA
#qanda East-Link had no business case. Government ignored Infrastructure Australia recommendations.

#qanda A litmus test? What are we looking for, extremist acidity or alkalinity?

The community is more tolerant and realistic than this government #qanda

#qanda sovereign risk - if it scares off rent seekers I'm ok with that
The children who witness an alcoholic parent are not laughing #qanda

Why is it that the youngest Muslims so disaffected? Any clues? #QandA
The mental health report found more people die by their own hand than are killed in road accidents or by skin cancer. #qanda

Australian drinking has a culture problem #qanda

Seat belts became legislation to stop deaths, but mental health... tumble weeds #qanda
That's fine Darren, that's fine. #qanda
Anna Burke looking fabulous, beautiful inside and out. A legend of a Speaker #QandA
Anyone else losing faith in Robb and his Govt's ability and will to get this done? #qanda
I'm not an Abbott fan but seriously, are we going to analyse him downing a beer? Come on. #qanda
The real problem is Australia's brutal treatment of helpless asylum  seekers in Australian detention #qanda
We don't need #mentalhealth funding shifted out of hospitals and into community. We need both sectors properly funded #qanda
Release the report! #qanda

I see a psychiatrist once a week that my parents pay for. I don't know what I'm gonna do when I don't live at home. #qanda
Mental health is such an important issue that needs to be talked about more. It's an illness not a lifestyle choice. Yay q&amp;a #qanda

#qanda Robb making shit up. The PM of Australia drinking on the job. Embarrassing and shameful!
The time for action on ice was two years ago. #qanda
Andrew Robb lied and said the migrants threw children overboard. #qanda
Swimming makes me smile too. Thanks Andrew Robb. Great tale #qanda
Remember when we used to talk about Western Sydney? #qanda
FFS it was a Peroni.......it's not even beer #qanda
Howmany so 7 people have died due suicide 2 woman per week #domesticviolence deaths so @TonyAbbottMHR chases terrorists #qanda #auspol

Hughes out of his depth  #qanda
I'm from QLD and I don't know what I'm getting angry about but it's going great #qanda
#QandA Bourke should take that sermon to the CFMEU worksite, or any picket line you'd care to mention. What a transparent hypocrite!
Anna for PM #qanda
@TonyAbbottMHR couldn't win me with policy but skull a beer, I'm swooning @QandA #qanda

@drkerrynphelps Indeed. And many of we mental health practitioners are locked out of Medicare. Many of us. #qanda @qanda
Good to see the younger generation getting into these topics ! #QandA
Australia does have a drinking culture. Period #qanda
Mental illness affects us all. Enough talking it's time to act. #QandA @QandA  https://t.co/7yhcIR8eiN

BREAKING: Melbourne-centric question fails to resonate with rest of country. #QandA
#QandA @QandA public displays of "Australianism" - The last resort of a politician desperate to cling to power
If 99.5% of Australia are "good", why are so many silent when someone's abused? If we are good, why are we silent? #qanda
#qanda #lateline
Mental health needs to be discussed more and more until the stigma fades. #qanda

#qanda Censorship of Sydney antiwar #Anzac100 meeting after extreme rightwing threats http://t.co/uVAqGTuE3U http://t.co/VAFO6ZLgB4

It's not "islamaphobia" if Islam groups are making threats or carrying them out #qanda
#QandA @QandA Allow ME to decide how many sessions are required. After more than 6 years of training, I know more than the politicians!!!
Most poeple have a drinking story #QandA
Let's get Ethan in the #ujcomm2657 Twitter club. #qanda
Mostly we need sufficient funding so people with acute mental illness are not turned away from hospitals when they seek help. #qanda
"Why does he have to leave?" No tougher question on #QandA ever!
Only is Australia can a panellist call another panellist on national TV a wanker. I love Australia. #qanda
@AndrewRobbMP : courageous against mental illness; absolutely happy to distort the truth on politics. A great shame. #qanda
Programs like headspace are crucial, but so are the community organisations supporting at-risk young people on the ground. #qanda
Just rip out the railway like Newcastle. #qanda
Ice is important, but I think alcohol is a far greater threat to the lives of young people. #QandA
Did Anna Burke know she's sitting next to a vegetarian while somehow lumping 'people who say not to eat meat' in with terrorists? #qanda
#qanda Andrew Robb: how does your understanding of depression extend to your understanding of what asylum seekers go through?
Goodnight all, another #qanda done and dusted. Love it.
Hinch: 'Greenies pushing people off the roads &amp; on to public transport! Just let us excessively pollute &amp; conjest, as is our right!' #qanda
People with mental illness are not headhunted for jobs... #qanda
An obvious LNP stooge #qanda
Better those young men talk garbage about Anzac attacks than go and hit women. Let's target a real problem #QandA
#qanda  Anna's first job out of Uni was at Vic Roads.  What as a lollipop lady holding up a sign at road works.
#qanda we should sack the judge that did not lock Darren Hinch up for life!
A few people at the top challenging stigma does not change day to day discrimination face by sufferers of mental illness #qanda
Best #QandA yet
@TonyAbbottMHR impacts upon everyone's mental health. Unable to comprehend his simple mind @QandA #qanda
#qanda lnp not listening to mh commisioners nothing new there
@QandA  People just don't like Tony Abbot. They do not trust him!
#qanda Andrew Robb speaks and Tony doesn't even leave a gap for a clap before moving to the next topic.
Huge cuts to mental health funding isn't going to help! #qanda
I thought the alcopops tax fixed this all? #QandA
There are plenty of more serious issues to criticise Abbott about. #qanda
The prevalence of mental illness can and should be normalised but talking about it from an early age #qanda
#qanda extremism or extreme behaviour belief to "Something"!needs serious controls. Social media is an indicator take a close look.
"I'm a small business owner" says the questioner as if it gives his question greater moral authority. #qanda
Did #qanda discuss this as a topic when Bob Hawke did this recently? #qanda
Who's ever had a good night out sober? #qanda
#qanda Well done Ethan the problem is a complete lack of compassion by a govt that lacks a soul or a social conscience
#qanda we are all humans just get along for the sake of the kids
Bit of a last century view from Mr Robb on drinking.  #QandA
I love waiting in my car for 20 minutes at the crossing #qanda

Watching qanda tonight reminds me of all the reasons why I decided to stop watching qanda
@MrDTJames She reminds of when #natashastottdespoja was on #qanda - fresh with ideas
There's nothing extreme about veganism. Well, nothing more extreme than killing an animal and eating its flesh! #compassion #qanda @qanda
You can't lay the extremist problem on the shoulders of the local Muslim leaders. IT'S A PROBLEM FOR THE GOV. TO SOLVE #qanda
Extremism in any form is dangerous #qanda
Possibly one of the most important, enlightening questions and answers in the entirety of #qanda
Hawkey was off the source when he was PM. #qanda
The high number of Australians who commit suicide should help explain why so many Australians are attracted to join a 'death cult'. #qanda
#QandA Bob Hawke was popular because he had great visionary fair policies, not because he could skoll beer. Abbott is such a try-hard.
#QandA Oh please, not even the Sushi Trains run properly any more.
Ethan. You are a little champ! #QandA
#qanda Tell the disassociated youth that an idle mind is the devils playground. That's what the Catholic priests used to tell me.
Consortium signed the contract with their eyes open. Knew the risks. #qanda
Thank you Ethan on #QandA. You're a young Australian to be proud of.
Abbott govt hasn't spent the allocated $$ on deradicalisation, only interested in the military response #qanda
You know the best way to radicalise young people? Let your government representatives treat them badly &amp; send police to their homes. #qanda
Encourage well being. Fatty liver, Diabetes etc costs the health system massively too. Along with Mental Health. Substance abuse. #qanda
@flyingcolours65 Well said. I hate his policies too, but good on him for this @AndrewRobbMP #QandA
Loving the light rail in Sydney. It works, it's clean and it's on time  #QandA
I don't know if Muslim leaders have done enough, but I do know the media hasn't been balanced though. #QandA

Go team microphone. #qanda
I was not depressed tonight, Sharks beat Souths #qanda

The media does have a lot to answer for in relation to whom is evil and good. #qanda
Good discussion of mental illness on #qanda tonight. More must be done to support our communities. #capril
@JB_AU @aleeb88 @QandA one is legal, the other not.
Nope Nope Nope Nope. First question on #qanda once again promotes Australia's growing bigotry.
There's big problems with insurance companies and declaring you have depression. #qanda
Would love to hear from Mrs Robb #QandA
there is so much truth in that. why are we waiting for them to need the hospital bed. #qanda
If you want to see visions of Jesus Christ, then come with me and we'll take some ice #qanda
Maybe Robb getting a hit from the sun is why the libs shut down climate bodies. #qanda @QandA
#QandA gold Joel:
Increasing funding for treatment is all well and good, but how to we prevent mental health in the first place?  #qanda
@QandA naive naive naive
Kids as young as 8 have been reported using ice in my district. Just horrible! #qanda
The most depressing thing for young people is governments addiction to growth in an over populated world #qanda
Take funding for chaplains and invest in mental health education programs for kids #qanda
Finally and intelligent question! #qanda

We still need more public figures like Andrew to talk about his experience with mental illness #qanda @AndrewRobbMP
Nice to see an open and honest discussion on the topic #qanda
We won't need east west link when we get our jetpacks #qanda
Oh here we go #qanda
Suicide, the real terrorism #qanda
The terror raids are tough. They could so easily be sensationalised crap for political agenda. But could be genuinely life saving #qanda
#qanda why did the nap thine govt extort Victorians. Illegal
Clearly many Australians should do a test on the definition of "Jihad" #qanda
Looks like Derryn Hinch is now looking to grow old gracefully. Not sure it's suits him #QandA
There's a bunch of psychotic looking angry people in the crowd tonight #qanda
@QandA @HumanHeadline @janeburns do u blame Australians for fearing these people? They are let off so easy.
Andrew Robb doesn't seem to realise that Tony Abbott is directly responsible for the social tensions in Australia. #qanda #auspol
#qanda ask @jeff_kennett on this one, alcohol is one of Australia's biggest killers and burdens our health care systems.
#Qanda http://t.co/9WEBCtJh4Z
Any level of fear elevated in society  is because the Liberals is there because the Liberals have sought to promote fear. #QandA

Brains create a baseline of 100x dopamine. Meth is 1250x. Simple 'happiness' can't compare. Addiction becomes, inevitable. #qanda
@anniedundun Probably not people who watch #qanda
Paramedics manage suicidal patients everyday with limited mental health training. We need more appropriate services  #qanda
#qanda the Abbott government cut so much funding to mental health. Robb needs to stand up!!
How about just teaching and preaching tolerance in schools, yeah? #QandA #auspol
Thank you for an honest answer, Andrew Robb. #qanda
We can't support elderly as it is. Where does it stop? #qanda
Alcohol is the crutch of the weak and tepid #qanda
Radicalism is a global problem that will only be solved with a global solution #QandA
Mr Robb, thank you for sharing your mental health journey &amp; helping with the stigma of mental health journeys! #QandA
I am still trying to "get over" @TonyAbbottMHR but he keeps doing really stupid things #qanda
Six Anglos discussing Islam and Muslims? Where are you expert opinions  #qanda
Tony isn't a drinker, more a quaffer. #qanda
I think we get it. Rules.  #QandA
@ccar1259 the #qanda symbol looks a lot like the anarchist symbol too.

@QandA really good program tonight.  Andrew Robb speaking about his depression.  Respect.

Makes you wonder how many people the media didn't pick up on #QandA
https://t.co/2x7LGM5opR #qanda
Did Derryn Hinch just give us a lecture on drinking? #qanda
Provide these young people with a place that provides a sense of community &amp; belonging, before they turn to terrorism #qanda
Simple answer: yes. #qanda
Hey @DHughesy it's up to you and you alone to make Andrew Robb lose it. Shouldn't take much #QandA
@AndrewRobbMP those dozens of orgs are needed to provide local support but need more stability to be more effective #mentalhealth #qanda
People bing drink before they go out to save money on drinks when they are out? #qanda
And a sterling answer from @janeburns #qanda  https://t.co/Winm69L4Iw
The students at my kid's school are reluctant to speak to the counsellor about depression because he's been replaced by a chaplain. #Qanda
THE MINISTER HAS THE DISCRETIONARY POWERS ... #qanda
What if you are depressed because you feel you dont deserve help. #qanda
Did ABC and Ten swap a @DHughesy and a @charliepick for a Waleed in the 2015 draft? #qanda
Goes to show how Islamic extremism and terrorism has impacted us if we are addressing it so vastly in most questions #qanda
How are Imams going to compete with social media when it comes to radicalisation of Muslim youth? #qanda
#qanda after being sober for a while, and working in the middle of a "party district", Australia's drinking culture is out of control
Depression is a societal reflection.  It's not just a personal chemical imbalance #qanda
#qanda why won't you let us in Perth join in instead of watching the recording hours later...?
Tony Abbott's being so hungover that he can't remember David Koch's name indicates he has an alcohol problem. #qanda
Why are moderate Muslim leaders expected to do things not expected of other community leaders #qanda
Scrapping the East/West link was a GREAT idea. No sensible person wanted it! #qanda
Alcohol culture question! Drink! #qanda
@koaladiary: Must say #qanda workplaces need to go a lot further to accept and cope with #depression
Mental health have suffered massive cuts to funding, big problem needing urgent attention. #qanda
There are some major challenges in transport- infrastructure makes a city #qanda
I can't believe this is even an issue. How could we? #qanda
@QandA what about the nations first peoples, were stopped from practicing their own culture and speak their own language, but that was OK???
#QandA  LNP and Republican Governments increase security risks here and abroad
@QandA Why should religion be tolerated? All religion is intolerant. #qanda
If  #AndrewRobb if it takes him six months to get over depression why doesn't the gov fund more programs for mental health. #qanda #auspol
It's a good thing tht the ABC provides those helpline numbers whenever they deal with issues like mental illness, etc. Good for them. #qanda
Pissweak questions tonight #qanda
#qanda so true Anna. It's important to remember that fundamentalism began with the baptists in America. Extremism comes in lots of forms.
That audience member is going to be ropable #qanda avoided the TPP!
Assumption is that treating depressn early will solve all problems - still in 1st stages of understanding the disease &amp; its managmnt #qanda

Don't blame me. I did not create the extremism!  #qanda

#qanda just, like, don't be big its, y'know?

Hawkey? 60 years ago? Robb, you're dreaming #qanda
YELLING #qanda
What about the 4 million spent on a climate change skeptics research centre? That wasn't a great idea. #qanda
#QandA so Andrew Robb how big a role are u up for? Speak up.
#TPPA - huge corporate takeover of public services + signing over sovereign rights but can't be discussed on #qanda Embarrassing 4 Robb?
@QandA Give @DHughesy the hand held mic, he's got experience with it. #qanda
there needs to be no more cuts to services of #mentalhealth and care workers #qanda

Andrew Robb gets all my respect for speaking about #depression live on National TV. This. We need more of this. You sir are amazing. #qanda
O'Brian, Napthine, Guy lied about cost benefit, traffic and betrayed DEMOCRATIC RIGHT OF VICTORIANS so Lend Lease reep. LNP liars. #qanda
#qanda Heartless governments do harm. Governments should be on the side of the vulnerable.
We're seriously devoting time discussing the PM drinking a beverage? #qanda
Andrew Robb - what a man! Take a bow... #qanda
Why hasn't @TonyAbbottMHR condemned or congratulated the #ReclaimAustralia movement? #qanda
If it was a private gathering what was the PM just casually hanging around for? A 'coincidence' sure... #qanda
#qanda we can actually learn from certain cities in the US 
Yes! Anna Burke. Preach it #QandA
Politicians need to get their head out of the sand and act NOW! #qanda
#QandA look at all our marvellous 1st world problems! Important but how about govt cutting $11B to #AustralianAid hits the world's poorest!
We need a reboot of ROMPER STOMPER, to show how bigoted we're all being... #QandA #AusPol
Absolute joke - Ethan has it sorted - how does this show Aussie mateship? #QandA
Andrew Robb having more trouble explaining this deportment policy than Brandis explaining metadata #qanda

Important role of personal stories in addressing the stigma associated with mental illness #qanda
#qanda Lets call it the Eaton rule !!!
@traceymtay Moments like Ethan's video make ABC and QandA worth their weight in gold.  I hope that poor boy is not deported now.
Poor form @QandA. Let's hope @RitaPanahi doesn't feel litigious! #hellhathnofury #qanda
A lot of young people with depression suffered horrendous school bullying. Let's fix that as part of a plan to address mental health #QandA
So great to see it actually being spoken about!! How refreshing #qanda
I pray for the day Australia gets serious about public transport! #QandA

I'm still undecided on this issue, I don't think I've got all the facts yet! #qanda
wtf? there is no god! it's a dream developed by men to maintain control over women &amp; 2 keep everyone under control by fear. @QandA
@JB_AU @SallyRMelb @4corners @QandA 
just because he skolls one beer we are talking about alcoholics? #qanda
White Australian boofheads need a litmus test. #QandA
Liberal plant stand-over men in the audience,  no amount of angry yelling will silence our desire for better public transport. #qanda
What a legend, @AndrewRobbMP speaking with such detail and openness about depression in his life. Bravo. And good luck with the #TPP #qanda
#qanda just as long as your pilot isn't depressed
#qanda change the rules

#qanda Government can't do everything for everyone. People need to take responsibility
#QandA Never thought I'd say this, but I'm agreeing with Derryn Hinch; What are we reclaiming sharia law has not taken over.
It's a national - &amp; an international tragedy, kids attempting suicide having asked for help. #QandA
@MariamVeiszadeh You are blaming the victims of Islam for starting Jihad. Jihad started over 1500 years ago. @QandA #qanda
It's first hand stories like Andrew Robb's that make you realise how common depression really is. #qanda
Findings are already translated into action goals. Govt is just delaying action now. #qanda https://t.co/QyW1VAHaWX
#QandA first world problems. Yawn.
Most optimistic estimate had 0.84 ROI for $10b #ewlink. So wasting $1.6b on it is a good idea? #qanda
Could our fear alert be heightened in Australia because we send our soldiers to fight in Muslim countries #qanda
Bit worrying when people with no clue about an issue are speaking on a panel #DaveHughes #qanda
#QandA  Aussie drinking culture is in our DNA, coming from mostly the poms. #ownit
It is not parody - I really do think Cronulla riots were legitimate #qanda - and yes #CompassionIsForTheWeak
#qanda Abbott is one pot short of a pint.
Hey @AndrewRobbMP Its a different era and age Abbott should know better, AND he is no HAWKE nor is he beloved #QandA
Ridiculous tonight #qanda
Careful #Robb- How many #BrokenPromises from #Abbott?? Huh? HUH? #QandA @QandA #AUSPOL
dave hughes has been great tonight, giving us a great voice on some serious topics #qanda
I've taken kids on public transport because I had no choice. Bollocks! #qanda
Who cares? A man drinks a beer legally. #QandA
Andrew Robb. Seriously? #qanda
So Andrew Robb's answer is yes, it was a popularity stunt. #qanda
Sorry religious intollerance is a thing in this country and saying all this wont do anything, actions speak louder than words #qanda
Dave Hughes on #QandA. What.
@preciouspress @AndrewRobbMP No. But it makes you wonder where all the profits would have gone! #qanda
Are there any liberal progressives in Melbourne? #qanda
Why would radical Islamists listen to moderate imams? #QandA
An 'ice conference'... #qanda
Ummm. He's sober. #QandA
Suicide is a serious public health issue not just a mental health issue to be managed out of the health portfolio #NMHCReport #qanda

White faces, white men of course they have sound  solutions  #qanda
Looks like #qanda was deliberately avoiding that question. Pressure from the LNP to silence any debate around the TPP? yep.
Once again Anna Bourke shows why the ALP should never be let near the public purse #EconomicIlliterate #qanda
STOP THE BOATS! Especially ones with autistic kids! #qanda #Abbottabad
@QandA Sometime he eats row onion.. now he skols a beer, is there anything #tonyabbott cant do, someone make him a PM.. oh wait!!! #qanda
Congratulations #qanda. There has some very sensible comments &amp; some frightening statistics unfortunately
*chin hands* Please, tell me more. #qanda
That statistic should be considered in relation to the perceived threat raised by the first question. #QandA
taking medications is one of the keys to defeating depression #QandA
Federal government should fund public transport, roads are not the answer. More public transport will reduce congestion on roads #qanda
@QandA @AndrewRobbMP the more money we give em- the more bloody threats they give us!! Its called Khilafah ! WAKE UP @TonyAbbottMHR

#qanda I don't want to trivialise ice. I am sure it is terrible. But when I was young heroin was going to 'destroy a generation'. It didn't
I did a litmus test on the new Aus "good government". It is a lemon.  #QandA
From the son of an alcoholic that doesn't won't admit he's an alcoholic, Australia has a drinking problem #qanda
Turn on #QandA and see a tweet from the fake Rita Panahh account published. Ugh!
Did the PM speak out about extremists in #ReclaimAustralia? No, but he asked Muslim clerics to speak. #hypocrite #qanda
#QandA @QandA 10 SESSIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH! The Mental Health Review STATES we MUST increase "Better Access".  Don't delay - MAKE THE CHANGE!
@QandA Minh Duong bashed and left for dead in Melbourne by 3 neo Nazis. After reinstating his cancelled visa He has graduated. Well done.
#QandA let's look after Australians first!
@QandA why wasn't there a cooling off period
Let's be afraid of Derryn Hinch because he has a beard. #QandA
Surely we can't just presume a simple linear relationship between radicalisation of beliefs and social media engagement? #qanda
I feel like a beer now. #qanda
#qanda When Tony Abbott came to power it all went to extreme.
Hi Ethan...I love you #qanda
Keep taking an interest in the running of your country Ethan. #QandA

#ISIL is threatening the worl? Really? #QandA
People want to live in the east yet want easy access to the airport. Snobs. #qanda
I don't believe social media causes radicalism, but radicalism does need to be looked at in light of social media. #qanda
Great. A panel of non Muslims talking about how to fix Muslims.  #qanda
#ABC #qanda Some goody two shoes there
Wonderful from Anna Burke. Suicide prevention needs critical funding. Must stop our obsession with hospital beds #auspol #qanda
#QandA   When we really are affected by peak oil we will want good public transport
As far as I'm concerned, anyone who votes for Abbott is voting for children to be raped, tortured and killed. Nice people, right? #qanda
Why is it shocking for men on Q&amp;A to discuss their personal issues with mental health &amp; depression? Over 30 men a week commit suicide @qanda
There are so many reasons to be happy inside, we've screwed things up #qanda
battling depression is adversarial growth #qanda
#qanda so now we are all going to be alcoholics. Get over it - it was a beer
We are such a fortunate country. We need to learn to share our resources #qanda
Anna Burke is one of our most human politicians #qanda
A phobia is an irrational fear. The fear of extremism in the name of Islam is quite rational #qanda
Good on you mate! Ethan, You should be seriously mad we're deporting your friend #qanda We need more politicians like this 10 year old..
Stop telling Muslims what to do about terrorism as if the two are intrinsically interlinked! #qanda
#qanda Why discuss this issue and have no representation from the Muslim community on the panel
Hawke admitted he was an alcoholic &amp; got off it when he became PM - Abbott is one but won't admit it. He's a bogan hero. #qanda
Want emotionally secure, well adjusted adults? Invest in high quality early childhood education &amp; care. #qanda

I haven't seen a #QandA tweet from Mariam insisting the #EWLink would have discriminated against muslims. Is it prayer time?
Do I hear gun shots in the background? I'm alert and alarmed.  #QandA
The look on Abbott's face at the pub. Was sad, begging to be liked by someone, anyone #qanda @qanda #auspol
#qanda McGovern - when was that Derryn? 1975?
#qanda @QandA is the kid being deported due to disability or due to parents do not have permits to live permanently here?
Much better than a foot in your mouth. #qanda
Should all athiests take a test to denounce or the neckbeards spouting bullshit in their name or #qanda
#qanda Is this girl flirting with Dave, or what?!
Mental health is in so many forms #qanda - we need to stop trying to find a niche problem to solve
Hey buddy @DanielAndrewsMP won an election by promising not to built that road! #qanda
Out of the mouthof babes #qanda
Bob Hawke 60 years ago? What???? Andrew Robb you're crazy #QandA
Would rather hear Robb talk about inadequate mental health funding #qanda
Andrew Robb's motto: fear fear fear #qanda
It's ridiculous that they demand all Muslims need to take responsibly for individual radicals #qanda
#QandA so why is he being deported??
None of you would truly give a shit about this kid. Get off your high horse #qanda
Still haven't heard an "It's all Labor's fault" comment yet! Nice one Andrew Robb! #QandA #AusPol
With all the issues to discuss this week #qanda you let THAT be the first question. Pft.
Insanity would be commit all Victorians to over spending on a small piece of road in Melbourne #qanda
Bill Heffernan and the ACTU are calling for govt to #ReleaseTheText of #TPP - even if @TonyJones_qanda is happy to silence democracy #qanda
There's not actually many people travelling East &lt;--&gt; West (about 6% only) #QandA
OMG I hate that Hoddle St bottleneck. Public transport solution please! #QandA
All this infrastructure talk reminds me I wish #utopia would come back. #qanda #auspol
Cuts to @WorldVision number $5,574,012 from Child Protection, Community Resilience and Clean Water Programs #reputationalrisk #QandA
#qanda Please start using the phrase 'Died by Suicide' opposed to'Commited Suicide' the latter alludes to a crime, the former, an illness.
#qanda Liberal government will do the same as what they did to the Gonski report.....pass the buck
Australians do not stand for inclusiveness. Almost no Australians stand up for marginalised groups. #qanda
The roads are private corporation contracts. Fed gov not interested in public projects. Only business with corps is fascist agenda. #qanda
No @AndrewRobbMP there is no compensation being paid in Vic for #ewlink. Don't spread untruths pls. #qanda
Workplaces need to take more responsibility for their employees mental health and offer assistance and support where they can #qanda
#QandA disenfranchised and unemployed youth globally need a sense of hope and are more susceptible to influence and coercion
Please make the popping stop. #qanda
Any chance can can address Australia-phobia?! #qanda
#qanda Hughsy - keeping it real - yeah we did binge drink actually...
Umm not sure what the question was? Wasn't that a statement? #qanda

Sneezing at the sun is called Achoo Syndrome #qanda
"if youre at all distressed by the mindless banality of tonights #qanda episode call lifeline on 13 11 14"
#qanda now showing fake - potentially defaming - tweets on live TV @RitaPanahi #easymoney  https://t.co/VwwBzRMCpC
We keep #criminals yet deport a child because he is autistic? Many of our gr8test minds wld be diagnosed w autism today. #qanda
Isn't it disenfranchised youth in general we should be working with? It isn't a Muslim problem #QandA
Let's drop the stigma about mental illness and educate the community #qanda
Prescription drugs are also destroying #Australians #mentalhealth- prescribed &amp; not supported. It's not just those that choose a ice #qanda
What a dishonest statement from Andrew Robb #qanda
It's inappropriate that Abbott celebrates by skolling in a pub whilst our navy delivers persecuted Vietnamese back to authorities. #QandA
#THEIRabc apparently they aren't .  #MediaBeatUp on &gt;&gt; @QandA
Sheikh al Ukelele. OMFG #QandA

Politicians go through a high degree of stress in their role. A majority of voters do not understand how hard it is to govern. #qanda
Nicely done #qanda
What a loud person #qanda
great story on 4corners tonight re universities.. will mr pyne fix it? #qanda
The business case showed what a terrible idea East-West was.  Should be a corruption enquiry into how it got approved #QandA
Hey #qanda can we please have a break down of the audience according to religious affiliation?
@JaneCaro Having crap periods n feeling lousy is totally different to genuine biochemical depression. #qanda
Binge drinking really stops being cool at around 21 years of age! #qanda
Alcohol is WAY more accessible than ice!!!  #qanda
#qanda is discussing cultural xenophobia, how we deal with this is a complicated issue. It starts with schools, family &amp; community
Our status in Australian society should no longer be measured by beer glasses or millilitres #qanda @QandA
@QandA @DHughesy it is one of life's mysteries that those who make you smile &amp; laugh carry their own inner demons i.e. Robin Williams.
If anyone watching #qanda has even ab inkling that something isn't right, seek help. Your problems are NOT too small.
Let's have a discussion about the Muslim community and invite zero Muslims #QandA
How about we change the rules on keeping asylum seekers in detention indefinitely? #qanda
Since when was our national anthem up for free interpretation - we've boundless plains to share or something, right? #qanda
At least he wasn't in his budgie smugglers at the time #qanda

#qanda qarule of law. Proof required derryn
Mental health issues aren't like a broken leg. Can't be seen, but that doesn't mean it should b swept under the rug &amp; not discussed. #qanda
Surely ignoring and worsening climate change is a sign of mental illness #qanda
We can't afford to keep our current roads in decent shape. Why are we so busy building more and more? #QandA
Great to have @janeburns on the panel to answer this question about autism having such direct experience #qanda
Muslims are being made to feel they are under attack in their own country. This is very worrying. #qanda
GP training would help a lot. Not always easy 2 speak up when the doctor is either non-receptive or misses the signs. Partic for kids #qanda
Some Muslims want to kill us and we have to taken lessons on Islamaphobia, excuse me? #qanda
Andrew Robb, who is negotiating the #TPP, thinks that the #EWLink was a good thing economically - we are so screwed. #QandA
It's changing, but young people understand the importance of speaking out #qanda #depression
Maybe less time on terrorism hysteria &amp; actually do something about our mental health issue that kills more Australian lives @QandA #qanda
Addressing poor mental health requires partnership. A unified sector is paramount #qanda #NMHCReport
the issue is the Immigration Act...its discriminatory. Chsnge it. @QandA #qanda
It's a bit unfair to a family to settle then be ripped up and told to move back to another country #QandA
How about investing the money in something more effective, like public transport or a more useful road? #qanda

ICE! EVERYWHERE!! #qanda
Really? You bring Ice into a conversation about the need for support and preventative measures for mental health? #QandA
How can Shaking a Ukelele be terrorism ? #qanda Tiny Tim was all about peace love and mung beans MAN !
@zogalog96 @QandA What did I miss?
Agree with Dave Hughes. Society is becoming so numb to drugs these days. #qanda @QandA #ujcomm2657
When Tony Abbott is in his swimmers being healthy, he's ridiculed. When he drinks a beer, he's ridiculed. Come on! #qanda
The election was not simply about East West Link. All polls show that the majority of Victorians support it #qanda
Powderpuff #QandA. #TPP will give corporations virtual immortality @ expense of public. 2 big &amp; fat 2 fail? #auspol? https://t.co/smgvzSjkQZ

Does anyone other than Derryn really go in for this 'human headline' garbage? It's actually his Twitter account too. #QandA #narcissist
Depression will skyrocket in WA communities which are to be closed! #qanda
#qanda Provoking suspicion of Islam in the West is the main goal of "Is". #auspol
What a good question. Regardless of his politics, Andrew Robb has become a great role model. #qanda
Ethan, you're a great lad but you should be in bed!  #qanda
This will be the most liveable #QandA ever. Go Melbourne.
#QandA What about other religions? Extremism is the problem, as Anders Brevik proved, not just Islamic extremism.
Publicity = govt action. #QandA
#QandA Derryn should be careful while critical of our Courts
How about a Catholic, a Buddhist, an atheist, a Moslem, a Jew, a Hindu, a Quaker on the panel? #qanda
#qanda Give everybody on the panel something to drink and they might start saying something useful
Guy in the suit who asked question 1 looks nasty #qanda
.@janeburns on the experiences seen in seeking mental health support @HumanHeadline says there's still stigma #QandA http://t.co/pwBU5AQLZN
Humans are tribal &amp; territorial by nature. We form self-protecting groups &amp; inevitably view ourselves as "seperate" from others. #qanda
It's not about Bob Rob! It's about our PM and this day and age "it happens" doesn't cut it! #qanda
It's a question of how much tax money we are willing to spend on expensive individual cases. #QandA
We as communities need to learn to be more supportive &amp; "friendly" of people with needs whether that be due to autism or dementia #qanda
Labor broke a promise the Liberals had no bloody right to make. #qanda
@lillebuen @QandA mate don't even get me started!
#qanda bring on the clowns
#QandA honesty is needed to lift the stigma be a victor not a victim
Great to see mental health being spoken about on #qanda tonight. #smashthestigma
Amazing support on Twitter tonight via #qanda for a society more accepting and supportive of #mentalillness
I, for one, assess political leadership on the basis of how well one eats a raw onion and skols a beer. I mean, what else is there?! #qanda
We need to fund #mentalhealth prevention, community-based services and 24/7 services online. #NMHCReport #qanda
This isn't the worst case of wasting money. That award belongs to the Howard government. #qanda

Deporting him based on his disability is probably a breach of international law btw #QandA

Soulless bureaucrats.... #QandA
How about the white panellists stop telling muslim Australians what to do? #qanda

Bitch, shut up ! Rude, dominating slag #QandA @QandA

Yeah and then when it's built and it doesn't work you'll complain about it #qanda
You can not justify deporting a 10 year old with autism. #qanda

It was known before the contracts were signed that the Labor would not go ahead #qanda
@QandA Australia needs to apply laws it's not Racism.
#qanda Hughesy is so out of his depth.
Why can't kids travel on public transport? #qanda
Voice of sense @janeburns - most important thing is connectedness #qanda
TPP please #qanda @qanda
#QandA someone close to me is troubled on ice. Horrible to see them
It's a ripple effect .. #coffecupfromjurasicpark #qanda @QandA
Whenever I see members of Tony Abbott's cabinet listed to appear on #QandA, i suffer from Premature Exasperation.
The only way to deal with #qanda is to have a drink.
#lnp so boring its akin to a depression #QandA
It's a pity media attention is required to make politicians behave with compassion. It makes media judge, jury and executioner #qanda
Because Dave Hughes is known as the Voice of Young Australian Muslims..... #awwwwyeahhhhnahhhh @QandA
SIGNS ON THE FOOTPATH ! OMG ! #QandA @QandA
Anna, vegan isn't the same as Halal! Know the difference, and know your dietary requirements. #QandA
Just another mistake by the PM who forgets everyone has a camera #qanda
Interesting to have a comedic personality on the panel!! Shakes it up #ujcomm2657 #qanda
#qanda a road has never fixed congestion
Abbott binged on public attention, #QandA
@DrRimmer no we have to discuss emotional issues that everyone agrees are shocking #qanda
#QandA POPE HUGHSY!
Liberal party will make a few million dollars and get off corruption with depression any day #qanda
For all his talk of 'mandates' federally, @TonyAbbottMHR is 'strangely' unobliging on Andrews' mandate #qanda
We may be all human but nothing will change whilst we act like animals #qanda
Im sure there has been men who committed a domestic violence murder and been allowed on bail... whats so special about terrorism #qanda
Anna Burke pretending Catholics are like Muslim terrorists. Nice! #idiot #QandA
Did Hinch just do away with the presumption of innocence in the legal system? #qanda
#qanda no TPP question, quarantine on Robb.
Shameful that a child can tell right from wrong yet we as a society can't #qanda
How hard has Cricket Australia tried to change their drinking culture when prominently sponsored by VB? #qanda
It wasn't called binge drinking, it was called the weekend. #qanda
Ice is soooooooooooo bad ! Don't do it !!! #qanda
65,000 attempted suicides in Australia. What is going on Australia? #qanda
How about all religions face a litmus test Fanatics are fanatics doesn't matter what their beliefs @QandA #Qanda
The apprehended men (a good portion of whom were apprehended have been released without charge) are innocent until proven guilty! #qanda
#qanda Robb is hopeless. 
Thank you for opening up Andrew Robb. Now, how do poor people access mental health care? #QandA
Let's change 'radicalize' to 'bad parenting' #qanda
Alcoholism/drug addiction goes hand in hand with mental illness #qanda
People with mental illness don't have confidence in the system. Not enough preventative care exists in this country. #qanda
Alcohol is the most dangerous legal drug available to teenagers whose brains haven't developed yet #qanda
Predictably, Mr Robb talks up the scariness.  #qanda
#QandA Mental health stigma will always endure while we remain identified with our minds. Mindfulness NEEDS to be championed.
The young men are innocent until proven guilty! #qanda
Why would we want an unproductive member of society? #qanda
How about we ask white Australians if they reject racism instead? #qanda
@QandA @abciview Soo many flaws within our judicial system.
#qanda Ethan, thank you for your voice. You set an example for many adults who, unfortunately, behave like children.
The east west link would never have solved any traffic difficulties, the cars are still there. Trains do solve the problem. #qanda
@QandA it's a very major report - duh!
All in moderation. Let's not get carried away with extremes one way or another #qanda
Tony thanks those that heckle Lib rep. Shuts down those that heckle Labor rep. Biased much? #qanda #auspol
#qanda @DHughesy &amp; @AndrewRobbMP did a lot to break down #mentalhealth stigma tonight - talking about #mentalhealth
Smugness is smugness on both sides of politics. #QandA
Oops, disgruntled Liberal supporters in "Do It For Dennis" T'shirts getting antsy in the #QandA audience.
#qanda Not all Muslims are jihadists.
Um Dave Hughes qualified to talk about politics &amp; Muslim radicalisation? Stick to footy &amp; jokes mate!! #QandA
Headspace is a great program but it is not a silver bullet.  A range of supports &amp; services are need to assist people mental illness #qanda
#QandA Vast Majority of Muslims are peace loving people
Mental illness is an illness- not a lifestyle choice. Definitely needs to be understood by all @janeburns #QandA #ujcomm2657
Let's not forget the mental health for children in detention centres. #qanda
You reckon a politician could get away with smoking a blunt on TV #qanda
Robb, why are we bringing children up in prisons? Ultimate depression. #qanda
Worried about Australia's reputation? How about cutting $11b to #AustralianAid hitting the world's poorest and most vulnerable? #QandA
Rules are made to be broken #ujcomm2657 #qanda
@QandA to many cases get ignored #QandA
#qanda once a rugger always a rugger
He drank a beer? Oh my god. Calm down. #qanda
mindfullness is great for depression look it up #qanda
@QandA it's a pity the ABC doesn't run ads @AndrewRobbMP to promote your restaurant...lucky Tourism Aust is picking up the slack #qanda
Much respect for Andrew Robb tonight. Open and honest with a willingness to talk about his experience #awesome #qanda #mentalhealth
Lol #qanda. So what Abbot had a beer get over it. Talk about important issues
It's good to see people passionate in the audience #qanda
@zenjito @QandA he was a very well spoken and passionate young man. Well done to him!
Robb being very honest for a change #qanda
i think ive finally come around to full blown hating #qanda. like its just terrible. i honestly cant remember the last good episode. cheers
#mentalhealth is woefully underfunded #qanda

Hughesy saying Warnie doesn't drink much, and Hinch condemning Abbott skolling. It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world. #qanda
@QandA I think poor Darryl is passed his used by date.
Turn off Hinch's mic. till he's asked to talk. #QandA
With the #NMHCReport out last week we are finally on to a mental health questions!  #qanda
yay, @janeburns on #qanda in 5,4,3,2,1....
It's very clear that our federal government doesn't prioritise or see the value in doing something about mental health. #QandA
QandA Too many apologists trying to toady to religious fanatics and nutters. Not enough voices of reason speaking out for truth and freedom.
Our cities will come to a halt if we don't invest in public transport. #qanda
It's always just a matter of time before Abbott does something stupid. And there's not usually a lot of time "between drinks". #QandA
Tony Abbott is an immigrant and a massive burden. Can we deport him? #QandA
Rabble rabble rabble #qanda
Having a son who suffers mental illness opened my eyes to how support makes a massive difference, but is severely under funded #qanda
#qanda tolerance is giving to others every right that you claim for yourself
There will be a shoe thrown any moment now #qanda
#qanda Andrews took the East West rejection policy to the election, Victoria voted and said no and Hinch wants him to break a promise?
@AndrewRobbMP can't answer a simple question, why is the text kept in secret. #releasetheTPP #QandA
#qanda Rob studiously avoiding TPP by distraction
Australia isn't anyone's for the taking. Especially not extremists @qanda #qanda
@qanda #qanda The Cronulla riots were about geography and access to the beach, not race, Mr Robb.
#QandA Why weren't we so freaked out by nuclear armed commos as we are by angry lone wolves?
Down with vegans!!! #qanda
@TonyAbbottMHR In Wollongong we are reminded ANZAC day is remembering  @SharonBirdMP #qanda http://t.co/xQPpTGa8Xx
@FOIcentric @QandA - A critical issue ignored #TPP http://t.co/OTlK6K4qbO
Victorians voted. Even Tones said it was a #EWLink referendum. The people who wanted it lost. Contract should have never been signed #qanda
What about the parents and families? These things don't happen overnight. Maybe they grew up with these kinds of radical ideas. #qanda
Everything in moderation #qanda
Dementia should also have increased funding. Dementia has higher rates than suicide #qanda
#QandA oh, come on! Abbott isn't aware he's being photographed.  Puhlease! As if! #qanda
We need to accept and define binge drinking more strongly.  #qanda
he hasnt written the cheque. the money was already give to them #qanda
Ethan, stand proud. Great question. #qanda
More funding needs to be put into the  mental health sector. You can't cure suicide, but you can prevent it. Getting help is costly! #qanda
Why isn't Anna on the Front Bench @billshortenmp? #QandA
The lousy @TonyAbbottMHR govt got rid of the Disability Commissioner! No compassion from this mob! #QandA
#qanda since when has Derryn been concerned about contempt of court?
Anna Burke, as always a voice of reason. #QandA
#QandA Another appalling lack of judgement on our PMs part.
#qanda derryn should have been thrown out years ago. Rabble rouser and bigot
@qanda #qanda the actions of the outgoing Victorian Government were disgraceful, and the people responsible should be in court
#qanda celebrate difference because that's what unites us.
Hughesy is a classic teetotaller. Follow his way #QandA
Anyone able to explain Dave's monologue? #qanda
Force cars off the road? Oh no, oh no- whatever shall we do #qanda
Want to stop radicalisation? Stop treating people like shit #qanda
The rules suck Robb. They suck  #qanda
Robb has used the word fear many times. Stoking the flames of fear against muslims prehaps? #QandA
A wine with dinner is ok then? #qanda
Great statement by Hughsie that the toughest guy in the pub is the one who doesn't drink #qanda
It was the PM who told us to be afraid, Mr Robb, remember? #QandA
How is ice a national emergency but alcohol not? #QandA @QandA
Government needs to take responsibility for not acknowledging the issue that is gripping Aus. De radicalisation of youth is extreme #QandA
More frequent &amp; reliable public transport would free up valuable road space for those that actually need to drive #qanda #springst
#qanda excellent answer by Robbabout depression. Wish govt would do more. Society issue. Lucky he accessed help- many can't.
Money spent on mental health reaps enormous social rewards #qanda
@EllyMooQ @NicGibson2013 @janeburns @rogueandrouge @QandA drop us a line info@yawcrc.org.au
There's a serious lack of acceptance in Australia. Of most things. Outside a very well orchestrated 'norm'. #qanda
Oh LOL. 2 weeks in a row with fake accounts on screen.  #qanda
Let's remove that stigma around anti-depressants! #qanda
Save us from the speaker Anna. #QandA
Go Hughesy, toughest guy in the pub is the one who doesn't drink alcohol. Spot on. #qanda
Robb's not convincing in trying to defend Sussan Ley. #qanda
Muslims in Australia have condemned ISIS and terrorism. But reporting that doesn't sell news papers. #QandA
Remembering back to when I was constantly asked to denounce Catholic led terrorism by the IRA. Oh wait, that didn't happen. #qanda
OK so now @AndrewRobbMP is the suppository of ...wait a minute. #qanda
Going to the funeral of two people who committed suicide within two months. That was hard. #qanda
Hawke never drank as PM #QandA
@Fluffula Add to that the decimation of the renewable industry #qanda
Mr Robb, this is your life. #qanda
who is this stupid old man?! #EWLink #qanda
@QandA @DHughesy I'm Separate.And an #HalfHourDelaySA makes me feel even more that way.Don't mention "The Occupation".#QandA
when is @DHughesy going to put on a funny hat? #qanda
#QandA lefties: Government should do whatever "the experts" say, or whatever "the sector" says. I prefer elected ppl to make these decisions
There will always be a problem with tolerance and acceptance of religions when young children aren't educated on the subject @QandA #qanda
Take a look at Europe. That is us in 5-10years. We must act now to stop it before it's too late! #qanda
Let's discuss Muslim extremism and islamophobia with an all-white panel, why not #QandA
@qanda any policy that builds community will be rejected.  Sad but true.
Super extra long edition of #QandA tonight because we have yet discussed why Melbourne isn't the nation's capital.
hypocrasy of Alcohol in this nation in is unbelievable #qanda
@QandA different levels of government coming together to tackle big issues such as mental illness will help with stigmas #Grass roots #qanda
There should be more awareness about beyond blue. #qanda

#qanda @QandA Hopefully we'll discuss France making fun of us on Climate Change! and Religious tax exemptions for non-charity work!
Monas was given bail so he could carry out his terror because he was infiltrated and close to his carrying out his task #qanda
there is such a thing as Responsible Service of Alcohol in NSW. Skolling beers is cautioned against. #qanda
#qanda and Derryn, you sit on radio bagging people with these issues!
What is the purpose of your devil's advocacy here Derryn Hinch? #qanda
#QandA fear is created by authorities by sensational raids
The referendum was run and @DanielAndrewsMP won. Bye bye $10.7 billion waste for a toll road that wouldn't work. #qanda
#QandA  Alcohol often used for self medication is also a contributor to depression
@QandA It was a cider #qanda
The cost of building the #EWLink would have been far worse a financial burden and wouldn't have eased traffic concerns #qanda
Why can't you take 3 kids on public transport? Hundreds of women, not as well off, do it EVERY day! #QandA
Give help early and money will be saved, that should encourage the Government! #qanda
@SamJaneLane @QandA @DHughesy he's good on the first time parents DVD too

Australia has been so lucky to have major public leaders talk about their experiences with depression and other mental disorders #QandA
We know Tony doesn't like the women to speak, but sabotaging their mikes? #QandA  :)
#qanda We must stop thinking that people who are not 'us' are all part of a job lot. Muslims are as diverse as any group of people.
Ice is bad alcohol is good, I don't get it. #qanda

How nice would it be in 'Bizarro world' if pollies just answered question factually, concisely &amp; took ownership? #QandA
I used to call alcohol my "anaesthetic" #qanda
Being in government certainly helps someone's spirits #qanda
People feeling depressed should call life line, or just turn over to the Simpsons.  @QandA #QandA
Aren't you supposed to be some kind of model citizen as PM? #qanda
#qanda Kill WestConnex too! If Labor had have had the guts todo the same in NSW, it would have seen them looking like a real threat
What a great line up on #qanda
Social cohesion starts by leaning English #QandA
Left and right politicians will change attitudes towards mental illness not just through $$$ but leadership.   #qanda
#QandA depression and mental health needs to be taken seriously and needs more funding to save more people

The folks who give a shit win, fuck #qanda

@ChrisAshton for once I'm not watching qanda. What happened?!
@QandA really what a stupid question about alcohol.  gee get over it
The best strategy to fight depression stigma is for well people who suffer from depression to speak out #QandA
Dear god, get off the TV, having a drink isn't a crime #qanda
Funding doesn't solve problems. Thinking differently does #qanda
Waiting for the government to announce a "War on Depression". #qanda

@pepsee45 @AndrewRobbMP Yep.  He thinks he's under control so that's the end of it for everyone.  #QandA
We need to increase funding and raise awareness to assist people from multicultural backgrounds to discuss #mentalhealth issues. #qanda
Nobody hires you if they know you have a mental illness #qanda
Ah well, you tried. #qanda
Ready your glasses to skull when Robb mentions having stopped the boats. #QandA
Andrew Robb, you are trying to make excuses here. #QandA
I wonder if young jihadist are suffering from a lack of mental health support?  #qanda
Our #QandA panel discusses the drinking culture in Australia http://t.co/onH8knOlDj
Tony Abbott was aware someone would post it on YouTube! #qanda
everyone knows that Melbourne is some kind of myth. like Atlantis or Troy or Canberra #qanda
No Qs on #TPP or funding #climate denier Lomborg addressed to Robb? Pissweak #QandA @QandA

The East West link was a dog of a project that would have never fixed congestion. What a Liberal shill #QandA
Love, love, love the discussion on #qanda right now. Mental health needs our full attention, and it's finally getting it.
The real question is when will Tony Abbott man up and move from mocha to a skim flat white as his daily coffee #qanda
@JacktheInsider why does #qanda support 'has been' baby boomers like Hinch and Germaine Greer
#qanda Martin Square? Really? Do you know your place Mr Robb? Glad you're looking after us.
What started all of this? The Iraq war. The war your govt took us to, Mr Robb. #qanda
#qanda Where's my jetpack?
Derryn Hinch is incapable of speaking on any topic without making it all about him. #qanda

@AndrewRobbMP talking about meds/swimming/art helping with managing his depression on #qanda BRAVO! #FundTheArts
If a boss even acknowledges depression as a medical condition, they're also thinking it is a long haul. #QandA
@fakeedbutler me too but no qanda which makes it even better.
Abbott's a Roads only scholar #qanda
More fail, less pale. #QandA
I'd be happy with the scrapping of the east west link so long as the airport rail link is the next initiative @qanda #qanda
Irony of having the Islamophobic narrative  negotiated by a panel with no Muslims. #Hijacked @QandA
why has the panel not answered the most important question? is it still raining in Sydney? #QandA
The media influences. Now it's time for the media to influence positively #qanda
#qanda if you were worried about stigma Andrew Robb you wouldn't stand for the LNP
What happened to innocent till proved guilty #QandA
Now that's a change of pace, think I need a drink myself #qanda
But Hawke was years ago and times have changed #qanda
Andrew Robb, well said.  Ps make your govt do more about mental illness #QandA
Are you sure about 400 people? Is data retention stats excluded?   #QandA
Only one thing worse than having depression - not knowing you have it #qanda
#QandA indigenous youth suicide rates are off the radar where is the funding?
Alcohol is a major sponsor of our major and grassroots sporting clubs. #qanda
Fuck off, woman and have a drink #qanda
Forget Religion fuelled violence, the bigger  problem is alcohol fuelled violence #qanda
But there is no Government money available and there are no plans to increase taxes !  #qanda
Give tax concessions for taking public transport rather than car. #qanda
Andrew Robb has saved lives in his electorate. There needs to be more of that level of awareness #qanda
Great question. Well done Ethan. This Government is a disgrace. #qanda
If the govt did something meaningful on mental health, maybe they might even get popular support? #qanda
In the #qanda audience tonight: douchebags
How is this a news issue?! Surely there are better things to talk about in Australia than the Pm having a schooner of a fine ale. #qanda
Andrew Robb showing us exactly what good leadership isn't while discussing fear #qanda
#qanda perhaps we should get Ms Triggs to investigate

This is melbourne... All you can see is roads because East needs to get west. Pfft take a ferry!! #qanda
tfw u see cuties in the qanda crowd
@QandA I'm not boring because I don't drink alcohol. Maybe those who drink are boring if they need to dampen their personalities with a beer
Excuses much. #qanda
Baba Ganoush so so #qanda
The young boy wins the night. Autism is not a reason for deportation especially in a child. Deport overstaying back packers @QandA #qanda
#qanda So Tony Jones expects Dave Hughs to have the solutions?
We need to encourage men in particular to communicate openly about their feelings. Men's Sheds are a great start. #qanda
so #qanda went to Melbourne for their special "hating on brown people" ANZAC special huh?
I'm no fan of Abbott and definitely don't like the drinking culture, but give him a break. He's a fit and active bloke #QandA
Our foreign minister wears a headscarf. No issue. #QandA
"You hope the raids don't make things worse" very optimistic Dave Hughes #qanda
Good on you Andrew Robb, may not like your ideology but depression knows no ideology, non partisan. You set a good example. Cheers #qanda

Before Hughes went to the psychiatrist with Mummy, he was in two minds. #qanda

@mtc01 @malaccio1 It's a weird discipline. ;) (It's why I try to shelve all/most my #QandA tweets off on a different account)
we seem to forget that radicalisation is a part of every society with young men, gangs, sports, terrorists, armys? #qanda
#QandA  Politicians especially have been known to have problems with alcohol
@goforgold80s #qanda LNP is totally anti mental health issues like depression. Our Many surfboard PM will tell you that. #auspol
#qanda thank you Andrew Robb. @QandA
#qanda I'll take that as a question. answer: fuck this show.

I think there's far bigger, more important issues that deserve air time than whether the PM can scull a beer. It. Was. One. Beer. #qanda
The logical solution to "higher interest rates" is to have the government borrow the money itself at it's AAA lower interest #QandA
#qanda hate breeds hate
The cause of all of this is lack if respect for authority. Bring this back and we will fix most social disorders #qanda
#qanda So what do you think about the government STOPPING treatment for depression before it's been completed? 10 sessions - NOT enough!
"pressing issue, islam" : let's ask dave hughes, andrew robb and derryn hinch. #qanda @QandA

#QandA   Will Andrew Robb be pushing Susan Ley to accept the recommendations?
Bosses fear what they don't understand &amp; can't control. Duty of care presses quite heavily. @QandA #qanda
#qanda just put up a tweet from a fake @RitaPanahi account. Top work.
Stop building suburbs with insufficient infrastructure. No need for more roads. Simple. #qanda
Thank you for the lives you change with your sharing like tonight  #qanda @DHughesy

Incredibly human response to a very human question. Good on you Andrew Robb, #qanda
Forget Warny, what about Bob Hawke after the cricket #QandA
Can't wait until they develop a brain scan or blood test to definitively diagnose depression. Concrete evidence will reduce stigma. #qanda
I can't drive. I like trains. #qanda

@QandA we closed mental health hospitals and did not follow through with community and outpatient services
#qanda Strong, fair, inclusive community must be the starting point. Would be good to see those sentiments emanating from the government.
#qanda @QandA  Robb disclose the TPP. Don't you get it - noone trusts bloody politicians.  EVER

Could Robb explain why no one his his government denounced the reclaim australia rabble?  #QandA
Whether or not the skol was staged is irrelevant, the issue is the drinking culture of Australia. #qanda
Far out #qanda
@QandA It will be interesting to hear Hughesy's serious side!
Q: was the election a mand8 on the issue? A: yes... #EnoughSaid #QandA
Fear monger media the cause of separation and radicalisation @QandA #qanda
Mr Robb can't blame public servants and the Tribunal for enforcing the rules government set. #QandA @QandA
Do not know whether to watch #QandA or #TheWaterDiviner

Horrible srory about the deportation if this child...shameful #qanda
Lay off Abbott on this - if he wasn't PM it'd just be another night at the local pub. #qanda

A culture that encourages competition in everything requires that for some to win, many will lose, then wonders why depression. #qanda

Allowing the government and media to create a culture of hysteria around Islam is letting terrorism win out. #qanda

#qanda society takes full advantage of people with "problems." It's a continuing stigma

@QandA Tony Abbott is just irresponsible, full stop.

Here's the thing, Australian morons. Infrastructure is not fucking roads. The goddamn fucking NBN is what we needed. #qanda
Tony Abbott plays Civilization video games and thinks that roads make armies move faster so he can conquer the Asians. #qanda
Tony Abbott has made a PR blunder. In other news, Pope is Catholic. #QandA

#qanda Jane has worked the Iron Triangle in South Australia - Respect!
@TheFacillitator @QandA that's too sensible..

"The toughest guy in the pub is the guy surrounded by drinkers who says: 'I'll be right.'" Word, Hughesy. #qanda
How does such a confronting and certainly extreme generalizing proposition make it on #qanda as the first question?

Virtually every country in the world has a drinking culture #qanda
Finally we're asking the right people how to stop extremism: Dave Hughes. #qanda
Australia's national habit of avoiding anything serious/being emotionally detached,an attempt to show how un-depressed they are. #qanda

Well @QandA proved tonight it's as biased and shit as ever. What a wasted opportunity to confront issues like #TPP
You'd be forgiven for not knowing that Robb was about to sign the #tpp #QandA
They use medical cannabis to treat depression. Was he talking about schizophrenia? They are different things Hughey. #qanda

#qanda terrible audio tonight. Lots of echoes, and the microphones are picking up everything Hinch says.
Andrew Robb takes us back to a time when there was a Minister for Multicultural Affairs under an LNP Govt #qanda
Heightened level of fear  - of course there is thanks to the gvt and media #qanda
Well I'm assured. As long as we have lots of little Ethans on watch we'll prevent so many travesties. #QandA
#qanda Robb the hightened level is due to your government creating this devisive issue,

#QandA deporting someone for a disability is institutionalised discrimination. Pure and simple. #unAustralian

We are a society that celebrates men's ability to drink over men's ability to show respect to women. #qanda
We're obsessed with hospital beds because that's generally when people are at their most vulnerable and unsafe. A touch important. #qanda

#QandA the question we all need to answer is "why is Australia a target?
We need to fund more early intervention and prevention services for children. Start early. #QandA

#qanda Indigenous Australian deaths by suicide are 70+ per 100,000. One in every 12-17 deaths is by suicide. Not a hyperbole, actual deaths.

@fakeedbutler @RitaPanahi @QandA I also 'refuse' to appear on QandA
Do Christians deny the Crusades? #QandA
#QandA deinstitutionalization was also taken to save money. It has a dark side too. E.g. less long term support.
#qanda young ppl suiciding is a tradegy, but they represent 1 per day. What abt the other 6ppl per day? Where is their headspace?

If @DHughesy has made #qanda I am done @sports_banter #QandA
@QandA Five Anglo-Saxon panellists, again speaking on behalf of the entire Muslim community.
The whole tony Abbott chugging down a beer thing always felt like an outdated sterotype to get younger voters attention. #qanda
@QandA gets politician on. Politician gives BS answers. Rinse &amp; repeat every week. #qanda
That's the first time I've heard someone talk so matter-of-factly about their own mental illness. Great stuff from Andrew Robb #qanda
Now the government has the report, how about they act on it!!! #qanda
Well done Dave for not only having the guts to stop drinking when you realised it was causing problems, but to also speak about it #qanda

A lot of problems come down to over population. No jobs, too many cars, millions of refugees, drugs to cope with troubles. Globally #qanda
Why is #qanda still talking about dead and buried #EWlink instead of looming monster #TPP?
Trending in Australia and The World: #qanda
Cue this government saying they have no money for hospitals. Never mind the $4 million for climate skepticism center. #qanda
@AndrewRobbMP talking about his battle with #depression is illuminating and inspiring. Hope it helps those affected. @QandA

Go Anna Burke, refusing to be talked over by Tony Jones #qanda
I'm guessing the #QandA panel and audience are outrageously outraged that the PM drank a beer, right?
@JoelStanton @RitaPanahi @QandA Have been invited is an easy question to answer please. #qanda
Why "radical?" Isn't the better term "reactionary"? #qanda
Any chance of a tweet with correct spelling appearing? #QandA
That mental health review was not genuine as it was not allowed to recommend allocating more money.Spends had to be matched with cuts #qanda
The Federal Government wants to subsidise trucking freight and that's all who is supposed to benefit. #qanda
@QandA the suicide rate amongst people with MS is 7times the background rate. Who talks about this ?
A guy drinks a beer. Who cares? A guy doesn't drink a beer. Who cares? Surely there are more important things to discuss @QandA
18 is old enough to know wrong from right, but if they consider terrorism to be valid, we've let these kids down #qanda

It's nice when you guys discuss the mental heath issues tonight #qanda
Depression doesn't exist in some societies. Hmmm makes you wonder about so called antidepressants. #qanda

Tony Jones one liners tonight, on fire #qanda
People's mental healt is not as important, culturally, than their physical help. We're always told 'toughen up'. It's not a weakness #qanda
Listen to the expert. #qanda
#qanda Abbott's having some fun with a drink with some young fellas...it's been blown out of proportion.
So why are there pockets of yobbos in the community not following the rules? #qanda
#qanda Police overuse of force and media overreaction to these raids contributes to radicalisation.
Let's have a serious discussion on the impact of alcohol. It is a serious issue for Australia #qanda

There's a reason it's called Islamophobia. Phobias are irrational. #qanda
Good on the #ABC for fighting mental illness stigma through discussion #qanda

#qanda previous deradicalisation programs involved cattle cars
Mental health is simply not a priority for the Abbott govt. It should be. #qanda
My twitter has crashed too @MegMcKenna97!! Nothing loading, or letting me RT... #qanda has well and truly broken the internet this week
Yes, you are saying exactly that Mr Robb #qanda
Hughes and Hinch...can't believe I just flicked on. #qanda
@QandA what happened to StephenKAmos #qanda
Medication in conjunction with community support. We need more of it for all sorts of mental illnesses. #qanda #ujcomm2657

Depression is treatable condition, although finding the right treatment that works can sometimes take time. #QandA
@qanda #qanda - Martin Square? Che?
Pretty sad conspiracy theory from Andrew Robb. #qanda
Thank god they fixed her mic. #qanda
why does it feel like Hinch is just trying to start a pointless fight w/ Anna Burke #qanda #ujcomm2657
@RitaPanahi @QandA To be fair, #qanda is fucking shit.
Meanwhile, asylum seekers (including children) with a disability are being caged in places without adequate medical care. Horrifying. #qanda
Wow how 'Australian' of us to deport a human because they have a disability. #disgusting #QandA
Only rich people should drive cars.....were did I hear that before?  #qanda
#qanda oh gosh, we're Australian. Let's not debate #alcohol
Great work @HumanHeadline - if being able to skol makes you more Australian then I don't want to be aussie #qanda @QandA

Never say young people don't have things to say #qanda
#pmlive Could get ugly on #Qanda tonight.

Public Transport Infrastructure includes disability access. #qanda
Give her Derryn's mic. #qanda
Derryn takes on the greenies. This will be entertaining. #qanda
#QandA Australia  is a disgrace around humanitarian issues. I despair for anyone who is disadvantaged, marginalized or disabled!
Lets deport everyone with autism, because having the next Steve Jobs here is not worth the risk #qanda
Where is the evidence that these 250,000 people are 'perfectly accepted' as Australians? Pretty idealistic #QandA
The Greenies are right Derryn. Public transport is the way to go! #qanda
Is disability a burden? I'm in a wheelchair and getting a PhD in autism research! #qanda
Hinch would like to thank #qanda for the free advertising
The producers didn't do great job vetting questions tonight clearly #qanda
We must all unite to continue to openly mock those that think Sharia law is a serious threat to Australia, namaste #qanda
There need not be any fear if there is a common understanding of what is needed here. Acceptance and freedom of expression #QandA
Why are they acting like Labor and the Greens want to tear apart roads and enforce public transport use nationwide....... #qanda
Intergenerational multicultural wars have led us to these questions #qanda
The elitist Abbott Government really needs to get over their abhorrence towards funding public transport. #qanda
The comedy fest finished yesterday...you're not supposed to heckle on qanda #qanda

I wish people would make this big of a deal when I drink a beer. #qanda
Yeah but cricket isn't really a real sport so they might as well drink. #qanda
also a problem when the birth of a nation is structured around an anglo based identity forged in a war against a muslim country #qanda
I am getting depressed listening to Andrew Robb #qanda
Abbott drank a beer in front of a crowd, but also ate an onion without any peer pressure. He is just an idiot. #qanda
Let's not give voice to Islamophobia through ignorant and inflammatory questions. #qanda
@godwingrech @qanda #qanda Tony Jones must love it.
I'd catch trains if they were clean, not revolting smelling sardine tins and ran on time.  #qanda
What's he saying? #qanda
@soniaahhh lol, that's what I thought. Why can't you take your 3 kids on public transport? Other ppl do. #qanda

We need to reclaim Australia from racism and white supremacy. #QandA
#qanda Go Anna Burke. Chisholm loves asylum seekers
What if we get a Muslims opinion on this topic?  #qanda
I don't see a high level of fear Andrew Robb. But I don't read the Murdoch newspapers or watch commercial TV news #qanda
Being concerned about terrorism as a personal threat in Australia is illogical @qanda #qanda
Seriously, a nation outraged by child being abandoned in Thailand because it was disabled will deport one for that reason? #qanda
@qanda Jane about to give it to 'em....you go girl
@juliemela @QandA @MsRonnyB thanks. Interesting to see if they do actually get to it.
CAN I BE DISRUPT THE PROGRAM THROUGH THE TWITTER STREAM AS WELL? #qanda
First person to ask a question looks pretty grumpy that no one is backing his loaded question #qanda #bogan
Robb is about the slip Tony Jones a note saying he can't answer this valid question because of his medication. #qanda
Person centred care seems like a no-brainer doesn't it? Mental illness is not something to sweep under the carpet #QandA
We should all lead by Ethan's example #qanda

Good on you @DHughesy '. Toughest guy in the pub is the one who says no' #qanda
Why aren't we spending some of the Future Funds billions on this problem? #qanda
Tony doesn't drink, he skulls #qanda
#QandA  Any connection between illicit drug-taking and youth suicide I wonder??
The verdict is in Robb joins a lengthening list of Abbott govt ministers not up to defending the indefensible #qanda
Should I de-radicalise my students or teach literacy &amp; numeracy?  Honestly,  teachers can't do everything #qanda
Hopefully this discussion can be the start of a larger solution. #qanda
Terrorism arrived in Australia in 1788. Now we are on the receiving end we see it in a different light   #qanda
Wouldn't have to pay out the millions had the coalition not signed the contracts and allowed the people to decide #ujcomm2657 @QandA #QandA
The sector is united and ready to act  #NMHCReport #mentalhealth #qanda
Why are Australian leaders incapable of discussing transport on MERIT? rather than whether one of their own broke a promise #QandA #choices
Plan it out in cities skylines #qanda
It'll take a lot more than skolling a beer to make Abbott popular. #QandA
Funny Kennett made me and many Victorians very depressed. #qanda
This lady on #QandA #lol
#qanda please don't forgot all us other minorities undergoing a beating... Go to any jewish community, we have all seen the worst of society

Oh I miss you in The Speaker's chair Anna Burke. #QandA
Spot on. Not good enough to be tolerant. We must be acceptant #qanda
God I'm not even watching QandA and I'm getting angry.
@Poursanidis @QandA Don't tell us you can't get to the hardware store without #EWLink being built! That $8 billion's better spent on PT.
LOL, #qanda claims 39% Coalition audience...we all know how false that is.
Almost half of the population has or will experience a mental illness in their lives. You are not alone #QandA #UJCOMM2657
Thanks for a great show @Qanda Go #qanda! https://t.co/iCr6pYyAAk
We need to talk about the self-harming and suicide attempts of OUR asylum seekers tucked-away on far-off islands. #QandA
Hooray Ethan! Standing up for what is right! Make no mistake, the government is wrong, wrong, wrong! #qanda
Learning about alcohol &amp; learning to appreciate it with food &amp; in cooking helped me to cut back #qanda
Really? This is a question? Share Warne is a pimple. #qanda
That is fucked up to watch a ten year old have to ask that. #qanda
Alcohol doesn't magically turn someone into an arsehole. They had to be one to begin with. Let's study a generation of arseholes. #qanda
#qanda thanks @DerrynHinch for addressing the stigma of revealing to employers re depression, often it can be used to diminish credibility
people blowing up at qanda for Rita's tweet, fucken hell
Australians are jealous that Muslims don't drink #qanda
@TonyAbbottMHR called the Vic election a referendum on east west link. The referendum was lost. Accept the decision of voters #qanda
Great question from such a brave young boy! #qanda
#qanda I wonder if we include the deaths of imprisoned asylum seekers in our suicide statistics?
#qanda DV kills one woman every week. Perpetrators of this crime, like extremists, walk free, thanks to the courts. The System is flawed.
@qanda Hinch is very adversarial tonight.....
I would happily live in a totalitarian state than be subjected to the alleged democracy of #QandA
@chriskkenny @randallgill @SERG1O_D much as I don't agree with a lot of what likes of you and Rita have to say, this is so poor from @QandA
I know where the gov can get the first $4mil from... debunking climate change #qanda
As #PMLive said, why is it only #Islam that needs that asterisk every time you mention it - *Yes, but most muslims are, um, peaceful. #QandA
This seems like a simple case of compassion. No discretion is needed #QandA
PMs recent 'skoll' achievement was no biggie but he has form with alcohol references and it's irresponsible #qanda
Watching #qanda on a Monday. Did I miss the #tpp discussion?
@aragonce91 can you ask what the go is with Kepler Grange races tomorrow? #qanda
Why is mental health suddenly a separate issue to alcohol consumption or terrorism? @QandA
Why is it still a mess directive action #qanda
Can't believe that I agree with Derrin.  He us right about the Ice epidemic. #qanda
So many of our good citizens are lost to suicide, futures lost to a mental illness, it's not meant to be a terminal illness. #qanda
#qanda School counsellors NOT chaplains needed.
Depression should not be stigmatised. We need to do more to address such a big problem. #qanda
Go to the video ref on this one. It was a middy! !!! #qanda
I moved from Melbourne just over five years ago and I still find myself swearing about Punt Road. #qanda
Nice little mention for @HSM_AUS on #qanda  fantastic organisation
Poor Robb stuck in the western suburbs of Melb while we are stuck with his disdain for funding services here #qanda
.@JL_Whitaker Should being drunk while in charge of a democracy be a criminal offence? #TAbbott #auspol #qanda
#QandA this is very sad. That's gonna hurt both of the kids @qanda
real terror is that which is state sponsored and directed at an entire population in the hope of subjugating opposition #qanda
Unfortunately there are some audio technical issues in this regional venue. #qanda
Hughesy said we are all the same but radical muslims don't think that way #qanda
#qanda Do not make a bit of fun more than it is!
#qanda On Sydney's airport train line every day I see international visitors board the train and comment on how wonderful our trains are
what is andrew robbs policy on BOFA #qanda
@QandA  Andrew Robb will you now advocate for acceptance of these recommendations with Susan Ley?
Finally, #qanda gives a voice to a group of middle-class white people on the topic of Islam.
Increased depression, suicide, alcohol abuse, drug addiction. As a society why are we so unhappy? #QandA
Abbott's skolling was a desperate attempt to keep relevant with the youth #qanda
even when I agree with Derryn I want him to shut the fuck up #qanda
i support australian multiculturalism #qanda
Islam needs a reformation now! #QandA
Protestors.  DRINK!  #qanda
Andrew Robb slips about the depression 'industry' #qanda
melbourne is the only developed city in the world that still has level crossings #qanda
And now the #qanda panda interpretative dancers!
Our justice system works OK Derryn Hinch.  It banged you up for some of your stupid actions. #QandA
#QandA drinking is a topic to provoke hypocrisy
Pollies are real people with real problems.  #QandA
It's criminal ... There is $ for negative gearing tax refunds but no $ to help people w/ mental illness &amp; #depression.. Arghh #qanda #auspol
God, it's so exciting when the audience misbehaves #qanda
Andrew Robb telling Muslim leaders "You've got the problem" - ignoring abuse and threats to Muslims by bigots #qanda Bigots ok by Brandis
Andrew Robb actually addressed that well. It looks like the public campaign will lead to a happy ending in this case. #qanda
Saying it for what it is, good on you @AndrewRobbMP #qanda @QandA
@brooke_aholmes @QandA Beautiful young humans such as Ethan are our future x
#qanda Talking about sovereign risk, how about that carbon tax?
@QandA Whatever you think of Robb's depression and med'n, the #TPP requires a reasoned considered response and not a compromised one #qanda
#qanda And Abbott told Andrews to break his promise. He'd know all about that wouldn't he? @14luxor @QandA
Wonderful response #qanda
Derryn Hinch is incredibly annoying #qanda
Respect to Andrew Robb. #qanda
Why does the LNP only talk roads and not Trains? #qanda
Dutton is too dumb to exercise the override. #qanda
Democracy fails when the PM skols a beer as a political strategy #qanda
Slow down your lives. quit glorifying money, possessions, status etc. keep true to yourself, you are good enough! #qanda

Andrew Robb cranking up the fear factor. Thanks for your help. #QandA
Great #qanda. Well done Jane @janeburns @yawcrc
How can we converse about radicalism in Islam without any Muslims present to discuss their own communities. #Islamophobia #auspol #qanda
flying cars man, we need flying cars #qanda
Andrew Robb is truly brave. If people think drinking makes you look tough then Robb might as well have downed 10 pints on live tv #qanda
There is nothing wrong with a drink, it's when a drink becomes 15 that is when the problems begin! #qanda
Subsidised Mental Health Care Plans were reduced from potential 16 hours to 10 hours PER YEAR! That is nowhere near enough #QandA
#qanda Robb, blame Labor for Abbott's drinking.
How do I know this tweet is from me? #qanda
And why isn't the funding into acute hospital care working? There still aren't enough beds!  #QandA
It's really important for @DHughesy to tell this story #QandA
It would seem the majority of your fellow Victorians did not want the link #qanda
The arts are the greatest thing to help depression #qanda
#qanda Be fair, Abbott mistook the beer for onion juice
Let's just use their metadata to stop the radicalisation!! #qanda
@thecattery @QandA @RitaPanahi or easily fooled. :/
Enough with these Melbourne centric questions. What about the railway crossing at Boundary Road, Coopers Plains?!! #QandA
Can't stand David Hughes #qanda
Asylum seekers get really depressed but they're not allowed to talk about it or get help needed. #qanda
I can't watch @QandA without having a drink #qanda
No religion has a mortgage on morality and nor does atheism. People should be judged by their actions alone. #qanda
Hinch didn't exactly get a world class education did he #Qanda
Muslim leaders speak out against extremists ALL THE TIME. But do they get any press? #qanda #auspol
Well the #Lieberal zombies won't die. #qanda
#qanda Social cohesion can only occur when we stop hating and start listening

@shane25873 My second youngest brother is a drug/gambling addict as well as an alcoholic! It causes far more than that! #qanda
Yeah a constantly drunk PM at the wheel of the country doesn't bother Andrew Robb.  #qanda
We also have an obesity problem #qanda
7 suicides/day in our country. Thxs Jane for highlighting a solution - person centred care #QandA
Why watch #qanda you know the issues already its just another hour of hate read 1984 you will see
Jane Burns doing a stellar job tonight, so calm and collected, a great voice for mental health.  #qanda #ujcomm2657
If you think building more roads will mean less traffic congestion then you my friend are an imbecile. #qanda
Deporting this child will go against everything our country stands for. #qanda
Why do we never hear about the biggest psychiatric inpatient group - Borderline Personality Disorder? #qanda
@qanda Robb saying that sector to go to corporations? Sounds like it??
This Q&amp;A has proved one thing : Derryn Hinch is totally irrelevant. #qanda
Tension doesn't have to create discrimination in society #qanda
All Abbott has to do is to open his mouth, pity he is our PM  #qanda
Cuts to welfare, primary health, mental health, public housing, DV services will result in &gt; rates of mental illness and suicide. #qanda
Why is it that religious-based violence perpetrated by muslims is "terrorism", whereas the same by Christians is "crime"? #qanda
Perhaps Moslem keaders would apologise when white Australian leaders apologise for Cronulla #qanda
Yes, it's clear the Left leaning media doesn't care about the slaughter of Christians @theage @theheraldsun @QandA  https://t.co/sRMbkx5M9Z
He's right, we all have different experiences with mental health issues. My depression is very much not improved by listening to jazz #qanda
People who suffer depression should get the help they need. But people who suffer from poverty need more help as well. #qanda
Everyone drinks to get drunk, anybody who says otherwise is lying to themselves #qanda
I know a company that after a medical was taken refused to hire someone who had depression in their past #qanda
Deporting an autistic boy to a third world country that will offer him NO support. How are we not scared for his life  #qanda
Yes let's hear the white Aussies tell us what the Muslim community should do #qanda
@QandA hugheys a bloody idiot he has know idea what he is talking about! #qanda
#QandA @QandA Dave Hughes shouldn't have just told @HumanHeadline he wasn't special. #BurstBubble
They could start by opening the gates at Richmond station after AFL games  #qanda
CAN I DISRUPT THE PROGRAM THROUGH THE TWITTER STREAM AS WELL? #qanda
Hughesy looks like he does so drink hehe #qanda
#qanda some bosses take advantage of those with depression and anxiety and #bully them

@qanda East-West proponent shot down in flames. Nice one Anna Burke. #qanda

#Greens and #getup take over #qanda shoe throwing next
Why should drinking mean you connect with younger voters? Still think Tony is an idiot. #qanda
Andrew Robb confirms that the Abbott government is stuck 30 years in three past when skols were cool #qanda
Well if the look at the social research data Australians are a lot more racist &amp; intolerant than the #qanda lets on
And this is great with ICE usage almost critical! #QandA
disgusting #qanda - deporting a child for having a disability.  Where have our anti-discrimination laws gone??
Robb lying about Abbott's #scullgate stunt. Not staged, my arse #qanda
Let's pull the rug out from under religion. Why give tax breaks to the root cause of all evil? #qanda
Beware the low level depression you will wish on us all by signing the TPP, Andrew Robb. #qanda
@QandA #qanda Love the venue. I flew home from Melbourne three hours too early!
I'm a life-long responsible drinker. Really sick of these wowsers who end up prompting over-zealous laws like lockout in NSW #QandA @QandA
You can't blame the Iraq war or Syria. We're still dealing with the legacy of World War 1 and the treaty of Versailles #QandA
East West would have cost waaaaaaaaay more #qanda
#QandA I'm confused? Do these mental illness advocates care about mentally ill people, or is it just about their federally funded jobs?
Abbot's skol was NOT spontaneous. There were at least 10 professional photographers there. Shameless PR stunt! #QandA
It was a stage managed attempt to endear the public #qanda
Islamaphobia can't be tackled if it's constantly being whipped up by the media #qanda
You know greater funding for case managers to give direct happiness-help to jobseekers at job centres would help a lot! #qanda
Let's ban drinking and smoking. Nanny state complete. Major revenue hole in budget then. #qanda
#QandA yeh to Dave Hugh's mum and every other carer who had helped a friend or family member experiencing emotional or mental distress.
What's frightening is the anger seeping out from behind the questioners eyes! #qanda

Abbott's just a knob. Stupid example to set. #qanda
A question for the panel: What can the rest of the country learn from Albert Park? #QandA
#qanda rail link to airport will make a huge difference
#qanda Andrew Robb has money, resources, support networks and a job to boost his self esteem. Many depression sufferers have none of that .
The drinking problem, like our supposed immigration problem is a drop in the ocean compared to that of the UK - perspective people #QandA
Imagine there is no country and no religion too  #qanda
All drug &amp; alcohol addiction self medication for inner pain. Teach kids it is ok to be emotionally honest. Straya doesn't do emotion #qanda
It is obvious he doesn't agree #qanda
Sneezing, smiling and music. Beautiful tips for facing mental illness on a daily basis from @AndrewRobbMP #qanda
@QandA Medications are a mask and must be supported with professional counselling.@qanda
#qanda abbott is a piss head . He's often hungover &amp; asleep in Parliament
Wow. The ABC has done its work beautifully in getting Robb on the panel tonight! Disaster! #qanda

#Australia's leading thought leaders talk about drinking while the rest of the world is talking about #climatechange. Priorities?! #qanda

Hey Chris Raine you got a great plug on #qanda @hellosundaymorning
Legislate to have alcohol replaced with water in all beverages. See the placebo work #qanda
All this hysteria over such a minor portion of a religious group... #qanda

Ok I have headphones now. Can hear #qanda
#qanda Excellent question
@QandA the Melbourne audience are very passionate. Andrew Robb seems not very empathetic considering is mental health issue
the last people disaffected youth will listen to is their elders it's their peers that need to speak up   #qanda
Watching grainy footage of sculling schooies at the pub. #Qanda  http://t.co/xuHrcu5eG6
#qanda please can we stop pandering to this "precious" generation &amp; remind them of their responsibilities to broader society.
Australia has a drinking problem #qanda

Easy to talk about what muslim communities should be doing to stop radicalism. But our attitudes that turn young people that way #qanda
Tony Abbott is still a muppet, beer or not. #qanda

Different culture, different value, different context. To me, there is no universal truth. #qanda #auspol

The minister responsible for the #TPP on #qanda for an hour &amp; not one question about it.
The women beaten up by alcoholic partners aren't laughing #qanda
I'm sick of the phrase "bloke culture"... Above all else, we live in a culture of insecurity. #qanda
@QandA @LifelineAust Are you offering counselling to the #Qanda audience - compulsive liars based on the alleged political makeup

Fantastic question ethan  #QandA
@QandA my mate just Called Deryn Hinch, Deryn Hinchcliffe!
No government expenditure can deter radicalisation that can't be fixed by good parenting. Or just chatting with your kids...  #QandA
We're dealing with huge levels of domestic violence, often fuelled by alcohol, great to see Minister for Women doing his best. #qanda
Too bad #Robb's govt creates a lot of stress and depression! @QandA #QANDA #Suicide rates go up under #conservative govts Proven FACT.

But public transport would solve the problem! #qanda
We have been talking for almost 2 decades about promotion and prevention approaches. Time to take action #qanda #NMHCReport
We have ways of making you deradicalise. #QandA
Everything I love about being Australian is captured - surprisingly - in tonight's #qanda where we can all be honest with each other
The fear is not unwarranted. The actions because of that fear can be. #qanda
I was raised in the 90s by a certain bunch of free-thinking turtles who were pretty 'radical' and I turned out just fine. #qanda
#qanda Todays lesson ?? Everything in moderation !!

Tony Abbott dors #qanda
Speechless . #qanda
If Andrew Robb is as unconvincing in the TPP negotiations as he was tonight on #qanda, we are in a lot of trouble. #auspol
Anna Burke is just so enjoyable, isn't she. #qanda
#qanda The liberal mindset is coming out. I can get healed from mental illness but you autist kid "go back where you came from". Sad.
There is a very strong link between drug abuse and mental illness. #qanda
Cracking episode of #QandA tonight.
Shame shame shame. There you go - I said it #qanda
Shame, shame, shameless self-promotion from Derryn Hinch #QandA
Wondering how long it would take to bring up skol gate #QandA
There are no Muslim's on the panel to defend themselves? Where's the fairness and balance in that? #qanda #ujcomm2657
Shame they couldn't get Tuckerbag on the #qanda panel to flesh out the credibility.
A few minutes in, and Hinch has already taken his first shot at the ABC. This sounds like a potential drinking game... #qanda
Cars, traffic, depression, getting frustrated because you can't get to work/home fast enough. The answer? more roads of course #qanda
Diversity will only ever work if everyone buys into the the culture and lifestyle. That being the 'Australian' culture and lifestyle #QandA
Maybe the Turkish are more peaceful as we're not occupying or bombing their country now #qanda
@QandA My tip for dealing with depression is not looking at my bank balance too often. #qanda

Person-centred care changes how we respond to "risk": to see people beyond risk, but also to challenge what we do when faced w risk #qanda
When suicides become statistics we know too many lives are lost! #qanda
I'd be happy with tolerance Anna, acceptance is just a bridge too far. #QandA
#qanda Our Media has Islamophobia because they never mention that the terrorists are Muslims.
Let me finish my waffle #qanda
#QandA as someone who is suffering from a serious mental health issue. Why is gov response so fragmented
No broken promises from the Andrew's government #qanda
The political class needs to work out if we wanted to live in London shoeboxes we would #GreenIdeology #InnerCityElite #QANDA
There are 400 priority ASIO investigvations Andrew Robb?!  I expect that the courts will soon be filled with terrorists.  Who knew... #qanda
Can we have a deradicalisation  program for free market fundamentalists? #QandA
@qanda #qanda the biggest problem we have is trying to squeeze most of the population into 3 or 4 cities. decentralise !
We arent all the same. We should celebrate that. #qanda
Headspace website not working. Awkies #QandA

If the courts can't see why deporting a 10y/o on discrimination grounds is wrong, there's probably something wrong with the courts #qanda
@godwingrech why isn't Hadley there?  #QandA
Ethan should be Prime Minister, and he doesn't even drink #qanda
To be fair, young people will never think any PM is cool, so maybe Tone should keep skolling until it's unfashionable #qanda
#QandA Thank you Andrew Robb for your honesty
Why do you think men join these groups? Because they're told they don't belong here? #qanda
Stop consulting, stop writing, actually do something about Mental Health in this country - reporting time is over! Do something! #qanda
if the bridge is a parking lot catch a train #qanda
I'd much rather having a drinking PM than a religious nut. Oh no, what a combo??!! #QandA
Onya Ethan !! #qanda
@qanda Hinch wrong on his logic....walked free might mean no charges to lay?
@QandA @HumanHeadline @janeburns if you dont like our rules go home !
More than 75% of suicide are men... @qanda #qanda
Any public figure that is pressured into doing something stupid loses respect instantly #qanda
#qanda gay men are 6 times more likely to commit suicide. How about we stop treating them like 2nd class citizens.
@janeburns thank you for your gracious answer to wonderful Ethan re autism question #qanda
Yeah. #qanda can get fucked this week. People are the worst.
I know people who have contemplated suicide because of racially-motivated bullying. Just a reminder of how damaging Reclaim Aus is. #qanda
How about we stop placing enormous value on being "tough" instead of teaching everyone how to be the toughest guy in the pub. #qanda
#qanda Iran's human rights abuses and Bishop are perfect matches. But would Iran have allowed the child sexual  abuse of refugee children?
Abbott blamed a hangover on calling David Koch "Chris" #qanda
I wonder if the politics of negativity makes our national problem with depression worse. #qanda
put your faith in Dutton. JFC #qanda
Just because they are rules, doesn't mean they're right #qanda
#qanda faaark - genuinely thought Hinch was dead. Delighted to learn otherwise.
Liberal plant. #qanda
From my home in the eastern suburbs, I'd take the East West Link, twice a year if that #qanda
The PM is one of the fittest men of people his age. He has one drink, albeit quickly. Give him a break. #qanda
@QandA absorbing and important tv think you
So #qanda isn't actually going to talk about the TPP and the harm that's going to do to Australia.
#qanda think I'll start walking about with a pen in my mouth from now on
Looks like we're quite happy to smear an entire religion based on the actions of a few nutcases. #qanda
#qanda @QandA ALp seems to be supporting the idea of everyone making spaces for muslims, Y did the Mp even say that? she is so dumb
We need a holistic, structural approach to change for improved #mentalhealth @QandA #qanda
REMEMBER THAT IT WAS THE GREENS THAT DONE IT #QANDA
#QandA is on fire tonight!
Important questions being asked about mental health. Well done #QandA

You would never guess Australia's Minister for Trade was on #qanda tonight, would you? #TPP = Trans Pacific Partnership = Corporate Control
@QandA Hughesy gets the line of the night...
It is so hard to get help, and find a good person to help you when you have a mental illness. It's not all about meds. #QandA
Art as relaxant... #qanda
No myki is worse. And why did the government sign the contract anyway??!! #QandA
Two questions on Abbott drinking. What a surprise #qanda
Talking is the best therapy for depression, people shouldn't have to suffer in silence #qanda @QandA
Travel people! Great cities have great public transport  #qanda
It's so clear for Ethan. #qanda
#qanda ice ice baby @HumanHeadline  you are correct ! You only have to  visit the public hospital mental health units

Our school just lost a Yr8 boy to suicide. 2 welfare coordinators to 2000+ kids. Not enough is being done to help. #qanda
Ah yes. That huge group of Ringwood to Geelong commuters. #qanda
Qanda time #qanda
Hmm, when I am squeezed on the train I don't see many politicians.   #qanda
We have a presumption of innocence until proven guilty in this country derryn. #qanda
#qanda kids, prams, wheelchairs all fit fine on HSR - 3hrs Syd CBD to Melb CBD its a no brainer!
And Mr Hinch has a crystal ball that tells him 65% of us now want the East West link #qanda
Kids are great advocates; they tell it like it is!  Good work Ethan :) #asd #autism #neurodiversity #qanda
Abbott hasn't got a drinking problem. Just a stunts addiction #qanda
#qanda 20 million people 150 fighters......really that high? More born aussies unhappy than that
What bloody Aussie can't have one light beer ? #qanda
We need more tandems. Enough of all these single occupant bike commuters! #QandA
Right off the bat, a ridiculous question #QandA
This sounds like some myth or story you don't believe because it's so horrible but then it's true and we ARE that cold #QandA
I say it every week, but remember that being anti-Muslim isn't racist. Religion is a choice. Race isn't. #qanda
Great respect for Andrew Robb speaking about his personal experience with depression. #qanda
Wait. Did Derryn Hinch actually just pledge to obey the law ???!!! Is this being recorded ? #qanda
#qanda once PM always PM, unless you're a woman, Andrew Robb?
Let's all remember that the LNP government is sending families to Cambodia. One of the child prostitution capitals of the world. #qanda
ice is the big drug epidemic that is hurting many around the world and the country #qanda
@QandA No disagreement between the major parties yet.
@QandA If funding is a problem we need volunteer organizations.
It's whacko o'clock on #QandA !
Be it radicalism, suicide, bullying, mental illness, or VAW - we need community action BEFORE tragedy strikes. Not cuts. #qanda
#qanda 400 ASIO investigations. is mr rob talking about operational matters?? Tony will have his job!
@reijin64 that's #andrewrobb @AndrewRobbMP typical #politicians arrogant wankers &amp; waste of space! #qanda

I'm sitting here alone watching QANDA and planing my death.  #qanda
Agreed Anna Burke - can't we shoot for something a bit more than tolerance? #qanda
#QandA Minister made a big mistake in this case, just admit it
Hinch has already spoken too much #QandA
How does re allocation of funds not equate to loss of hospital beds ? #Qanda
Suicide prevention misses the point. People are driven to suicide by events in their lives. Give people money and time. #QandA
We are about to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the landing in Gallipoli. Not one question or remark #qanda @QandA
Too often it's difficult to get mental healthcare unless you've "lost it". #qanda
Andrew Robb is right. #EWLink will be built soon and #DanKirner's dumping of contracts is just a political exercise. #qanda #springst
Hurray! A voice for public transport!!! #qanda
The only person Tony Jones doesn't talk over is an interjector #qanda
@QandA Headspace does not work. I myself went there and the counselor barely showed up! We need more support! #Q&amp;A
Absolutely! Yes! #qanda
First time watching this show. I'm hooked! Mind rattling! #qanda
#QandA - My experience is that you disclose mental health issues, your workplace uses that information against you. Its tough.
Abbott followed the exhortation of a drunken mob in Double Bay .... next time in Lakemba .... don't think so #qanda
Is litmus paper halal #qanda
@QandA Deporting any child goes against everything this country is supposed to stand for #qanda
It doesn't just sound terrible @AndrewRobbMP, it is a terrible situation #QandA
More funding is needed for Preventative health #qanda
When did Australian governments forget that we are a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child? #QandA
Anna goes bang.  First time she's been given a look-in all episode! #qanda
#qanda I grew up with an alcoholic parent, put me off drinking for life
So glad my son was born in Australia so his autism can't be considered a national burden... #qanda
Why is #QandA about Islamophobia. What about the terrorists?
Me after seeing the #qanda panel: http://t.co/rogNbQKrUj
Religion rhymes with Fiction . . . for A Reason. #QandA
I don't respect Andrew Robb's politics but I respect his courage #qanda
So important to see a rich white male opening up and smashing #mentalhealth  stigma #QandA
#qanda Went to a suicide funeral where the family played the Theme to Mash!
....and @DHughesy too - so important that this is spoken about #QandA
You gotta spend money to save money? #QandA
Listen up employers people with mental health issues can work #qanda
#qanda Abbott's Islamophobia now government policy as Andrew Robb defends it. Remember the 1930's in Germany...
#ABC #qanda have now put .@RitaPanahi  life in danger by deliberately letting this imposter screen tweet through http://t.co/B7Egy2xz6a
I cope with my depression with anti depressants and my cat #qanda
Tony losing control. Burn him! #qanda
Wait you can test for litmus now? #qanda
@QandA @janeburns @HumanHeadline unfortunately there probably always will be.
#qanda Anna Bourke for Opposition Leader! More articulate and passionate than Shorten.
You need to be a sociopath to run a corporation! #qanda
EW link was a political exercise on both sides of politics #QandA
ICE is a symptom not a problem. treat it as a health issue. #qanda
Go Ethan, lead the younger generation #QandA
#QandA there are more opportunities in Afghanistan than here. Even life is more affordable there and they have less depression.
Yes, 300 NSW DEC #schoolcounsellors had @janeburns share these insights today. We're at the coal face &amp; on the cliff with kids. #qanda
my drinking friends have a university problem #qanda
Psychiatrists have long waiting lists and medicare supports 50 visits a year. Available psychologists only 10.  #qanda
He wasn't looking for attention Mr Robb? Skolling a beer while being cheered in the middle of a pub? #QandA
#qanda What is that fucking noise!
TPP should have been talked about #qanda
Ohhh mother I can feel the soil falling over my head,as I climb into an empty bed, enough said...The Smiths #qanda @QandA
Dementia will become the number 1 cause of death in the next 20-30 years. Let's talk about that #qanda
David Hughes I think I love you @QandA
All the one person cars can be on the train and then it won't be as busy for the tradesmen. Sense? #QandA
We don't do enough to address the cause of poor mental health. It's SOCIAL #qanda
But how can I feel like a man if I'm using public transport? How will my vehicle purchasing power impress people? #QandA
Great exchange on depression. #qanda
Love the guy who stood up and asked a personal question of Mr Robb. Shrinking the divide between politicians and the people. #qanda @qanda
@janeburns refreshing to hear you talk #qanda it's a national emergency and we have to act-NOW
#qanda  i'm missing half the dialog cause digital reception is shit in a deluge rain kills aussie internet
Insightful. #qanda
#Qanda @TonyAbbottMHR spent $ on a photographer instead of a youth suicide councillor
Why not more funding for mental health outreach projects? #qanda
@QandA beyond blue is one organisation. Is depression one illness?
@QandA @HumanHeadline future is frightening anyway as a matter of course - ice and co scare the bejesus out of me #qanda @HumanHeadline
Nobody hears about drastic effects some anti depressants have on ppl w depression! Takes nearly diving off a bridge b4 you realise! #QandA
Holy fuck @qanda If you want to air a question, make the parents ask it not their 10 year old puppet #qanda
As long as it was a VB #QandA
hughsey  making more sense with no answer than Anna Bourke #nowiveseenitall #qanda
Missing link for the ring road was never considered. #Melbourne #qanda
@QandA  governments that make divisive policy create feelings of isolation it is no wonder young men are radicalized.
Derryn, having a go at the courts... That's a shock #qanda
Lots of people will jump up &amp; down about it being wrong. Until they are asked to put their hand in their pocket for financial support #qanda
#QandA The nazis had a set of rules.
Actually, I don't have fear of the community, I fear where racism and our current government are taking us #qanda @QandA
Maybe the Abbott government should fund properly planned projects. Melbourne metro rail #qanda
Victoria voted Andrews in on no EW link people #qanda
From what Robb's saying, the LNP have not got a clue or the inclination to do anything without the nod from who...?? #qanda
Abbott just proved he is no Hawke... Again! #QandA
Nothing wrong with drinking in moderation. #qanda
@MayasDragon @QandA @janeburns If kid was born in Oz even on working visa I imagine status was different. Someone else cleverer will know.
.@BlueIrons, where have I heard that before ... Ah yes #Doncaster Rail, #Rowville Rail, etc, etc. #QandA
Get mental health funds in your budget @JoeHockey 7 a day is 7 too many. Suicide is not an option. #QandA @QandA
Derryn has had a couple of people deported. #qanda

A woman wearing a hijab fears walking our streets whilst there are christians in the middle east that are dying for being Christians. #qanda
If a child sees such injustice, why can't our politicians? #qanda
Mentally healthy workplaces are so important and @beyondblue do an amazing job at breaking down stigma #qanda
Andrew Robb, experience with depression makes people empathic and compassionate. Why are you so evil? #QandA
Andrew Robb failing to mention the sovereign risk Abbott govt has posed to green investments in Australia. #qanda
Not a fan of Andrew Robb's politics, but good to see a LNP pollie come across as an intelligent human being on #qanda - pretty rare
If people of means struggle to find help with mental illness, imagine how hard for someone relying on public system only. #qanda
Agreed! Alcohol isn't compulsory. #qanda
Are you kidding me?! Deporting a 10 Y/O boy for "being a burden on on the health system"? Disgusting #QandA
That kid wins #qanda
Ride a bike #qanda #cycling
#qanda @QandA after being sober for a while, and working in the middle of a "party district", Australia's drinking culture is out of control
#qanda Why are we linking drinking with manhood, when it's only stupidity that can be linked with drinks.
Binge drinking is just not prime ministerial behavior. #qanda
Why is wine offered at 'high class' meetings? #qanda
Small business owner hates Labor Party. Big shock. #qanda
@kelsojado: "It's a real tough one" wow Dave Hughs.. out of your depth maybe #qanda
#qanda Religious leaders don't makeup community;government does.It's socio economic than religious issue, don't push the blames on imams.
I drink to make things like this more bareable. #qanda
#QandA @QandA If a report identifies a need, governments need to act on that need and not commission another report that fits their agenda
Oh my goodness. My heart. This little boy has more compassion than our politicians. #qanda
Alcohol is fine in moderation. Getting wasted every weekend can only be bad on health and on society #qanda
@QandA #QandA Wow Andrew Robb accusing Andrews of "threatening sovereign risk", no Mr. Robb the #TPP WILL threaten national sovereignty!
"Approximately seven people a day are committing suicide in Australia" #qanda #thesadtruth #askforhelp #someonecares
I am hoping that this case is isolated. Sadly, I don't think it is. #qanda
Andrew Robb says "it happens".  No Mr Robb, excessive drinking is as unacceptable as domestic violence.  It SHOULDN'T "happen"...  #qanda
Build a rail line to the airport, and East West isn't required #qanda

That wasn't a fucking question. #QandA
How bout a world-class subway system? #qanda
Lots of #qanda sympathy for @AndrewRobbMP talking about depression as LNP drives refugees to suicide, closes shelters &amp; remote communities.
Extremism needs to be eliminated. What about William Blake's epithet the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom? #qanda
Well done Anna Burke, always impressive. You have my vote! #QandA
The matter of local radicalisation is complex, of course - @AndrewRobbMP makes some very insightful comments on how complex it is #qanda
The Raids were a show of power by the Abbott government.  It happened last year. 100s of police do a raid, only ONE arrested! #QandA #AusPol
#qanda @qanda how about High Speed Rail, particularly between cities?
Did Dave Hughes ask Tony Jones a question then? #qanda
Australians really are incapable of looking overseas and seeing how other cultures handle difficult subjects, aren't they? #qanda

Just another case of the Liberals shrivelling up at the prospect of spending money on welfare, no matter how urgent #qanda #auspoI
@qanda Robb ' meds are obviously working well.  He is now as a LNP minister unwilling to support the most vulnerable and at risk
We build social cohesion in our communities by telling the fascists that they are fucking morons. #qanda
There's no need to compare which drug is worse than the other. Alcohol abusers and ice addicts should be equally helped #qanda

#qanda I didn't realise @HumanHeadline was so soft . So the PM had a beer, so what . @PMOnAir Hinch just hates Abbott

Oh we're not doing the 'just following the rules' schtick, are we? #qanda
A deep and insightful analysis of the problem by Robb #qanda
Why wasn't Andrew Robb's TPP discussed?! #QandA
Interfaith dialogue = a conversation between religious adherents, that should solve a couple of things #qanda
I'm ropeable! Let's stop knee-jerking about refugees &amp; their mental health.  Bring them out! #qanda
.@andrewrobbmp Will you be releasing full details of the #TPP before it's signed? and why the secrecy to date? #qanda #auspol
@vanbadham And suburban imams for ISIS. Jesus wept. #QandA

@qanda you are a role model for coping with depression Andrew Robb. You make good sense! #qanda
Were all Catholics asked if they rejected Irish terrorists? #qanda
#QandA  Dutton is the minister not very hopeful
Prevention. Not hospitals #qanda
A quickly signed contract is worse for sovereign risk #qanda
the fact that tony abbott downed that beer so passionately epitomises how awesome a leader he truly is #qanda
@NassimKhadem @QandA yep maybe it's a chance now
Well said @janeburns, social cohesion should be our focus rather than division and fear mongering #qanda
Hold on this sounds bad, but let me put some spin on it. #qanda
@SamDickfos Not many people understand mental health unless they have it or live with someone who has. #qanda and who doesn't? So prevalent
Yes I agree with you #IceWorstDrugEverInvented #qanda i know ppl who's lives are ruined by Ice #qanda
Have you been on Hoddle st? #qanda
#qanda the problem is mental health is not sexy for the government
Why do so many people have mental illness? Is it because they see no future? That it's a dog eat dog world and we're in fear? #qanda
Mental health needs both medication and lifestyle change #qanda
Q: was the election a mand8 on the issue? A: Y  #qanda
Add one bogan racist to tonight's audience numbers #qanda
Islamophobia is not being prevented. It is being encouraged. And it will destroy social cohesion. #qanda
Those who know him say that Andrew Robb is a good man and competent minister. But on tv, the charm does not quite come through. #QandA
@QandA stop selling mental illness-- get your hand out of the sick till.
The current govt won off the back of a very clear msg to can the East West link. Obviously Victoria didn't want it to go ahead. #qanda

@lari_freires You're trying to fight civilization, that's what you're trying to do.   #qanda
@qanda Why is @AndrewRobbMP selling out Australia to US Corporations #TPP #ReleaseTheText.
Domestic violence is destroying more than a generation. #qanda
The problem talking abt "tolerance" is finger shakers from the Left looking for problems to "solve."No lectures=less problems #qanda #auspol
#QandA why does Andrew Robb take so long to say nothing..?
#qanda For goodness sake can we show some humanity?
Look at the stigma tony soprano had to deal with  #qanda
@qanda #qanda Drinking ok? Maybe. What about putting a liqour store on a state highway &amp; one of the most dangerous roads in Aus? Not ok.
Derryn Hinch is a bit of a legal expert, I understand #QandA
It isn't about Abbott drinking - it is that he was behaving like an teenager celebrating 18th birthday #qanda  sad and embarrassing
Introduce the french drinking laws #qanda
Robb is right...you don't just "knee jerk"...but you don't sit around doing nothing either... #qanda
Only #qanda hosts can afford a car. Isn't that what our treasurer said?
Less talk about stigma, more talk about service provision around mental health #qanda
Diversity adds a beautiful richness to society but @DHughesy on #qanda ??? That's a bridge too far. ;-)

It comes back to Abbott he is the least accepting of any culture #qanda
Role Model in the drinking culture ! #QandA

People are on the Eastern Freeway because there are NO FUCKING TRAINS... #qanda
@QandA educate parents who will educate kids - keep the kids on sport and other activities idle minds leads to trouble
Depression is epidemically growing. With human life going further and further away from instinct. It needs as much attention as Ebola #qanda
I think I'm over this episode already. Tired of the scaremongering #qanda
@TheCalebBond During #QandA they publish all sorts of fake/parody accounts for the points they make.
Signing the EW Link contract was an act of pure political bastardly #qanda
Inciting violence is the issue, the foundation of ideology where it arises does not matter. #qanda @qanda
Derryn Hinch already talking way to fast to even understand him...SLOOOOOOW DOWN!!!! #QandA
Only surprise is that Abbott was not wearing a fluoro vest. #QandA
What was your point Andrew Robb? #qanda
Lovely question re #depression on #qanda
If the government were serious about 'national security', they would fund de-radicalisation programs. #qanda
#qanda noone. is. addressing resource issues of services for mental health @QandA

Meds alone not enough but can provide foundation for progress. #qanda #mentalhealth
Ive always been impressed with @AndrewRobbMP he has achieved a lot in govt with FTAs @dfat and shows guts to talk about depression #qanda

Meanwhile fed govt hurting workers with psych injuries #comcarechanges #qanda @unionsaustralia
Madonna rang and wants her headsets back from the panel. #qanda
Derryn Hinch with a nice contemporary example of depression stigma in the... 1970s #qanda
Derryn Hinch wouldn't be called the "Human Headline" if he wasn't always looking for one. #qanda
@QandA YES!
Why is off-shore suicide so unimportant?  We are mocking people who are desperate. #QandA
Vegans are definitely extremists #qanda
@QandA Tony Jones &amp; Andrew Robb U should be ashamed of yourself. U said that the #TPP would have a question &amp; it ignored stalled. no answer
@JohnSafran There's a particularly skanky bin near the entrance to Coburg Coles. Can #qanda fix that please?
See how sexy public transport is? #qanda
Oh no. The utterly uninformed frothing forth their opinions on #qanda with all the surety of extreme ignorance.
Some Christians are looking forward to the end of the world - that's scary #qanda
@RitaPanahi @QandA Oh dear - looks like someone doesn't know how to use the word 'defame' correctly.
Litmus test? WTF? Did that guy pay for his education through those agencies on #4corners #qanda ? Are muslims acid or alkali?

Would the blokes on the way to Syria swap their tickets for a spot on the Q&amp;A panel? Then we might pave a road to understanding... #qanda
@QandA We talk about sending people we don't like to their country; where do we send 4th generation Australians that are out of favour
Agreed, it's a bitch trying to get to the Eastern FWY via Eliott Av @ Parkville &amp; Alexandra Ave @ Olympic Park from the West side #qanda

THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING EATING DISORDERS @janeburns #qanda

@QandA we have acceptance, they don't accept us Australians
Lets talk about the TPP #qanda
Bullshit #QANDA
Andrew Robb getting confused over where #EWLink goes now. 0.45 BCR, simple maths. #qanda
Ask Napthine that question. He signed the secret deal #qanda
@QandA we are all unique, just like everyone else #QandA
What a joke, the trade minister comes on #qanda and there is not one question about trade #auspol
#QandA recognize Counsellors with Masters degrees &amp; PhD who are also trained in evidenced based, quality mental health not just psychs.
But rich Robb. Your govt has broken so many promises and is damaging Aust's reputation.  #qanda
Bob Hawke wasn't Prime Minister when he downed a yard glass, Andrew Robb #qanda
Light rail is the obvious solution, more roads attract more cars with the driver only inside #Qanda
It's a BOF fest #qanda
This woman is insufferable. #qanda
Ice is terrifying. Tackle the importers and manufacturers. But don't forget alcohol makes Ice pale into insignificant. . #qanda
Abbott is whipping up the fear to take the focus off his pathetic government! @QandA
Oh bless you, you beautiful boy, Ethan. #qanda
The difference is Mr Robb the hierarchy of the Catholic Church was actively involved in protecting pedophiles. #qanda
7 people a day? Lost to suicide in Australia? That is crazy, tragic. Aussie mental health services are in the middle of an emergency. #qanda
#QandA @QandA Why must government red tape impact the most important aspects of life?
"Look around this room at the diversity" yep and then look at the panel #qanda
Radicalisation is good for Abbott. It takes our minds off his incompetence - and he knows it #qanda
We all agree that depression is awful. But agreement does not a good #QandA episode make
#QandA Given his experience of mental illness,how on earth can @AndrewRobbMP support mandatory detntion that destroys people's mental health
You get on a train and see an Asian being yelled at to "speak English." No white people on the train stand up to defend them. #qanda
Fantastic question regarding depression and coping mechanisms. Talking about it reduces stigma #qanda
@DHughesy telling it how it is #qanda
The questioner is raging!! #QandA
Skol! #qanda
@qanda I dont remember gays getting extremist and wanting to bomb people when they were marginalised and being gay was illegal
#qanda . People with drinking problems are not just people who lack willpower. Often they are traumatised.
If you really want to send a strong message about binge drinking get Mark Robinson off TV #qanda #afl360
I've known ppl who've worked in mental health who redundantly say,if they want to kill themselves they will.It's sad wilful ignorance #QandA

Abbott doesn't want to be seen to be giving money to "soft" (read: preventative) measures like preventing extremism #qanda
#qanda Brain washed by the politicians for their own gratification by Islam-a-phobia rhetoric !!
#qanda Heartless immigration dept. Disgraceful.

@QandA why are we surprised that this Govt. Is so cruel
Mental health killing more Aussies than terrorism &amp; affecting so many more. Compare the funding &amp; attention #qanda @QandA
#QandA Rob is talking crap and why are we giving our infrastructure programs to foreign companies. Hello
Does student debts and lack of mental health services help de radicalise?  #QandA
This #qanda could turn one to drink. How is ONE BEER a bigger national issue than Islamic terror attacks?
@QandA in 2014 the World Health Organisation announced that alcohol kills 1 person every 10 seconds worldwide. We must bring about change.
It's in the constitution. S76 (v) Once you're Prime Minister you're always the Prime Minister #qanda
Derryn is correct. #qanda
It's okay to say I need help. #qanda
Wouldn't it be great if an Andrew Robb said to Ethan "You're right. I'll make this happen. Leave it with me." #qanda
Watching #qanda has made me thirsty. I'm going to skol a coldie
I support celebrating #diversity but can't help feeling the emphasis on it can mean we fail to highlight the things we have in common #qanda
What about the 'we'll get to that' question on the TPP? Qanda
If I hear of another mental health awareness campaign, I'll scream! Those funds can mentor youth one on one. #qanda
Yay video question! #qanda #technology
#QandA Muslim don't want to be part of us they segregate themselves by calling Australian Muslims in stead of Aussie
Surely the responsibility of our leaders is to put this in perspective #qanda
Andrew Robb, I salute you. #qanda
#qanda love Anna Burke.

Ethan is a Champion,God bless him #qanda
@QandA The legal system is based on legislation by a government that are the facilitators of this
I rather think our refugee policy has done more damage to Australia's reputation. #qanda
#Qanda #THEIRabc The case would be looked at. 
That is already enough #qanda for me, cya
Are we happy our government is pursuing a policy directly intended to cause mental distress to vulnerable people seeking protection? #QandA
I agree @TonyAbbottMHR 6.3sec p*** poor #qanda
Australia does have a drinking culture #qanda the amount of bullying i got in school for not drinking was a joke.
#qanda Kids say the darndest things - and they're often talking common sense! Good on that kid, Ethan!
#qanda services need to be available before a person  gets to rock bottom
Yes, that correct spelling is skol #qanda @sezzzza
#qanda Yeah let's enjoy our lives.
Australia has a legal system not a justice system.  #QandA
Great discussion about mental health interrupted by light rail and roads the rest of Australia doesn't care about. #qanda
#QandA Islam is a religion of fundamentalist fanatics. Anyone recall Salman Rushdie and the fatwah for writing fiction? I bet not.
Did Derryn just say Ukulele? #QandA
Qanda no system! We need to have a mental health SYSTEM
Ice is the terrorism that effects all communities, brain damage from use will affect us all @QandA
But how can anyone make big money out of it? #QandA
the guy that doesn't drink is "toughest guy in the club". Wise words. Hughesy for PM #ujcomm2657 #qanda
Working in social work, I have seen how ICE is ruining a generation. DV, mental health&amp; child abuse. ICE leads to all of this &amp; more. #QandA
@QandA Not a lot of Aussie multiculturalism on display in tonight's panel.
Anna's so right! We have to tackle mental illness via community action BEFORE, not hospital beds AFTER the fact! #qanda
I go blind when I look at the sun... #qanda
I don't need to drink, I'm already rolling on the ground, drunk with laughter #QandA
How do you give yourself a high-five? #qanda
No mate, no no no. The department needs to reimburse his mother all her tax upon deportation. #Ethan #qanda
Plonker alert. #EWLink #qanda
One of the first things the Abbott government did after getting government? Cut psychiatric visits by 20% #QandA
#QandA Could it be because of a certain ABC program that talked at length about someone turning up at a hospital and not getting a bed?
Abbott sculling a beer made me nearly like him for the first time. #qanda
Dave hughes as vacuous as ever. #qanda
Humour is the best weapon. Mock the white racists and mock the terrorists, #qanda
The black dog impacts so many, yet, Ice is the only thing the government is concerned about #qanda
Andrew Robb opening up about stigma surrounding mental health... onya! #QandA
Great work @janeburns. Well done. #qanda
We do NOT have to "tolerate",let alone "accept",everyone or everything Anna. #QandA
We have technology to change traffic lights based on traffic demand. We don't use it. Too many trucking company friends in politics. #QandA
Terrorism is not an epidemic in Australia, giving it, and extremists, so much publicity only contributes to the issue. @QandA
We need to stop and really think about the way we are living which causes people of all ages to take their lives #QandA
Dave Hughes had depression... And he did okay! #qanda
Hughesy &amp; Hinch. This will be ugly #qanda
Far too many fall for the cracks #QandA
This govt does not act on policy... Unless it can blame Labor for doing so. #QandA
Stop handing out money to useless people who WON'T work and funnel it into mental health help #qanda
Less face to face contact in this technological age makes it easy for mental illness to go unnoticed. #QandA
@QandA #QandA If they're the department's rules, change the department
Maybe a Muslim Australian should be on the panel tonight on #qanda
Hey I think this guy is a Liberal voter #qanda
#ProTip: skipping Monday night #QandA ensures a relaxing start to the week.
@QandA hughesy train wreck during question 1
Why is Dave Hughes even on the panel? #qanda
"Walking down the Yarra River?" Is Dave Hughes confusing Muslims with Jesus? #QandA
#qanda if skoling makes you an Aussie man I don't want to be one, says Kiwi Hinch

One of my teenager choir friends committed suicide a couple of years ago. Absolutely terrifying time. #QandA
@LaLegale @QandA 'What' is still not 'why'. The biological causality of it is not well studied.
Oh god. Andrew Robb makes me want to sob with boredom #qanda
Great to see @yawcrc on #QandA - go follow them! :-)
#QandA ice important of course Derryn but not a scrap of the damage alcohol inflicts
Did Tony just back up #mediawatch story on brand/content collision with a free plug for Hughesy? Seriously? #QandA
The biggest waste of govt money would be $4Mil to a Danish climate contrarian #QandA
Leadership as nothing to do with Islamophobia. It's got to do with the bigotry inherent people who hate. #qanda

"Defending the indefensible"?  Tonight Robbo defended de-funding of mental health services and deportation of an autistic child. #QandA
Abbott downing a schooner was a deliberate tactic devised by spin doctors to make him appear more Aussie in lead up to budget #qanda
Abbott Govt reduced mental health funding .. His Govt doesn't take the issue seriously #qanda
That you just said that, that you love a drink. You felt you had to say it. That's a problem #Qanda
Inspiring to hear Andrew Robb discuss depression. Disappointing that Liberal is no better than Labor in funding public treatment #qanda
Mental health closely tied to diet and exercise. #qanda

Bravo to Andrew Robb for his brave and brutally honest recount of depression. #qanda
We're not all lucky, when I was diagnosed bipolar1, I was stood down from work for 20 weeks, they felt I was a safety risk #QandA
Would love to know the panic levels Derryn Hinch's solicitor must feel every time he opens his mouth on legal justice issues. #qanda

Try as he might, Andrew can't put lipstick on the pig #qanda
Where's Abbott's captains call on mental health #qanda
#QandA  extremists have been influential in social reform. Ghandi, martin Luther king, suffragettes, jesus.
#qanda  Abbott wrote the cheque.   #auspol
A sense of belonging, community capacity building and local solutions; local and timely mental health treatment needed now  #qanda
So from HUGE national issue...to listening to whinging Victorians...gee, this is sad!!! #QandA
#qanda  The liblabs both wasted Victorians money trying to make each other look bad and both succeeded. Victorians deserve better.

What possible relevance does history of funding have? Fund public transport. #qanda

I think we need laws to prevent Australians joining vegan terrorist cells overseas. San Francisco, for example. #qanda
Stupid question - they money is withheld because it was for a specific project. #Qanda
The previous Liberal Gov should not have signed that contract 2 weeks before the election. Liberal irresponsibility yet again #QandA
No religion should have to apologise for the actions of a few extremists. #qanda
#QandA Much-needed discussion re: stigma of mental illness, with this lacklustre and (largely) ignorant panel. Next time eh?
Warney was probably paid for his comments #qanda
GP training would help a lot. Not always easy 2 speak up when the doctor is either non-receptive or missed the signs. Partic for kids #qanda

3 cheers to Anna Burke! #qanda @QandA

Story of hope from @AndrewRobbMP on @QandA tonight
Mr Robb calls out the community and asks why are they missing in action  #qanda he is so right @AndrewRobbMP
Doomsdayer Robb #qanda
10:37PM and no talk about #TPP ? Why have Robb on then? #QANDA
My heart is breaking. My nation has lost its soul. #qanda
#qanda Does Andrew Robb really think there have been more tension between Australians or is he just blindly following his leader's line?
@TheCalebBond @QandA @RitaPanahi 
Depression and alcoholism stigma for men in a macho culture are two areas that need erosion. Neither make you more or less of a man #qanda
When did drinking a single schooner become excessive or even considered binge drinking? Take it as a comment, move on. #qanda
#qanda Why does this government only want to consult on topics they have no desire to act on?
#qanda Down with ice!
Andrew Robb doing well to encourage the fear. #QandA

Snap out of it. Is still a common response, the community needs educated. #qanda
Tony Abbott skols a beer. Discuss. http://t.co/Ol0AjRvKT7 #qanda
When you're depressed, you feel worthless and undeserving of help. People need to be taught how to recognise it too. Some won't ask. #qanda
The stigma around depression must be broken in order for people to people to experience freedom! #qanda
#qanda Robb suggests that his Govt needs to be the one to calm the fear brought about by terrorism &amp; radicalisation LOL @QandA
#qanda abbotts cuts to mental health is perpetuating the problem. 
Beyond Blue. What a perfectly descriptive name that contains its own hope. #qanda
#qanda Gutsy lid
Combat depression by including in secondary education curriculum: basic psychology. Teach adolescents psychology at their level. #qanda
It wasn't even a question to start with was it? #qanda - why's it being answered to...
Y'all have to stop doing that thing where every bad thing is exclusive to the right. It's myopic #qanda
#qanda coming from sunny coast QLD, drinking starts much too early amongst young Aussies. Definitely needs some looking at.
When the extent of your argument is 'It's the rules', you have to reflect on your decision. #qanda
The sooner we can remove the stigma the sooner we can develop solutions #qanda
The dying Napthine government was prepared to sabotage Victoria's sovereign risk. #qanda
The crime is hypocrisy...Abbott railed against binge drinking culture in the media #qanda
If there is not more research, support and money put into mental health, nothing will change #QandA #UJCOMM2657
Communicate, talk, ask questions, be compassionately curious and name the elephant in the room when it comes to mental illness @QandA #qanda
Great question Ethan #qanda
The whole 'my friends say it will eventually happen so just do it' argument also applies to gay marriage. #qanda

Meanwhile the big elephant in the room is admitting there is a clear and distinct link between Islam and violence #qanda
@QandA can @AndrewRobbMP Rule out the concerns regarding TPP in association to Australia's sovereignty?
Where is our structural analysis of mental health? The social determinants play a huge role #QandA @QandA
Half of our community? Yeah, not quite there with the maths Anna... #qanda
How quickly would Abbott govt react if 7 Australians a day died from terrorism not suicide? #qanda
@QandA it is not racist to want to debate about Islam and Islamic extremism #QandA
Noone would ever say to their boss they have depression. Sad but true. #qanda
A 10 year old boy just pwned the government.  #qanda

US Rebublicans in Texas think that early support trumps hospitalisation...what's the barrier to action Aus Govt?? #qanda

Medicare funding for access to psychologists has made a huge difference to #mentalhealth treatment #qanda

#qanda The real question is why is there so much Depression? WHY.

#QandA Newsflash Andrew Robb! Bob skol was 30 years ago. Of course it was a setup any idiot can tell that. More the fool you for denying it.
#qanda when you are representing a whole nation, it should not just happen!!!
Abbott drinking a beer is a bit of a beat-up. I mean, we don't need to keep normalising its binge consumption, but come on #qanda

Dave Hughes comment of the night "are there more foreign companies that want to invest in Vic for a free $500m :) " #qanda
The first step at dealing with depression is talking about it! #QandA
Andrews went to the election with it. The people of Vic have had their say! #QandA

In case I don get enough politics in the day... I watch #qanda at night!

This latest impulsiveness by a PM who drank half shandys til now is only one of a strange pattern of behaviour. He ate AN ONION fgs #QandA
No-one has asked for the entire Muslim community to apologise. They have been asked to voice opposition to the radicalised violence #qanda
@QandA No one cares about addicts. Comorbidity of addiction and mental health issues is very high. Stop the stigma ALL round. #qanda
Why can't you take your kids on public transport? I took my two girls all the time. #qanda

#qanda - Writing a cheque will not resolve 'suicides'. It will help with the availability of Community support.
#qanda talking sovereign risk and east west link. Real risk was our own sovereign which was going to waste &gt;50 cents in the dollar
Why are we still talking about islamophobia in this country are we not in the 21st century multicultural country #qanda
@QandA By focussing on roads, the govt. can look like they're actually doing something #qanda
#qanda WTF?  Australians are Australians.  It doesn't matter who they follow it is where they live.  My mates came from everywhere.
I actually like some local discussion on #qanda -- mixes it up. Wish it'd move around the country more regularly to hear more local issues.

Hughes nails Hinch. He is a wanker. #qanda

Dave Hughes, prime example of Darwinism #qanda
These people are all Australian. The only un-Australians are those that are threatening our society #qanda

Robb on Abbott drinking: He was not looking for a camera shot... I don't feel this is any great crime that's been committed #auspol #qanda
That's the point, 60 years ago Hawke did the same - things change, it's called progress #qanda
legalise marijuana and half the gomestic violence and public assaults will simply vanish, lower costs to society all round  #qanda
Is Robb spilling the beans on operational matters? #qanda
When did Australia lose our compassion and only focus on and see dollar signs? #qanda @QandA

What about factors like the expectations of daily life and unnatural environments we've created? Not everything is biological. #qanda

Public transport will not solve cross-town traffic issues #qanda
Really there are idiots out there who still blame Daniel Andrews for Denis Napthine screwing over Victoria. #qanda
#qanda "Sets of rules"? Bugger off!
Australia's immigration policies are a national disgrace #qanda
The reason the TPP was silenced on #qanda tonight was because it is fundamentally corrupt and opposed to Australian interests.
Does Derryn have a bit of a chip on his shoulder re the justice system? Seems to be preventing him from answering the question  #qanda
#qanda http://t.co/cFlqPSwu8V
My mates told me something I liked to hear... #qanda
'@AndrewRobbMP is living proof that people with a lived experience of mental illness make an enormous contribution to our community #qanda
Seriously Andrew Robb couldn't explain himself out of a paper bag. #qanda
Great to see qanda giving ppl without a platform some well deserved air time
#qanda if you let a problem breathe, the bigger, the problem becomes. Shut down social media channels with offensive connotations
One thing is to say we're accepting, it's another thing to actually take actions to show so #QandA

All this talk makes me want to drink #qanda
#qanda What triggers depression ?? Monetary, lack of income or incompetents of  achievement or is it a geneticall problem ???
Poor people need &amp; use public transport. #qanda
The guy asking the question looks like an extremist #qanda
#qanda I suffer from self diagnosed depression as I'm too scared of not being believed by doctors so I can't bring myself to go to see one.
It's @QandA o'clock!
Why don't we ask some Muslim Australians how to combat Islamophobia instead of a bunch of white non-Muslims #QandA
#qanda Andrew Robb continues to vilify Muslims, while excusing neo fascist 'Reclaim Australia' followers?

Get back to the mental health issues  facing Australia  is more important to our nation  rather than a road / bridge in Melbourne #qanda
What is this question #qanda
For fuck's sake. It wasn't irresponsible drinking. What is wrong with you people? #qanda
Tony Abbott is seriously misguided. We know public transport and cycling resolves traffic congestion. Someone is feeding him bull#### #qanda
It shouldn't have to get to the Minister. The stress the boy &amp; his family have been put under is disgusting! #QandA
He wears speedos gets hammered, rides a bike gets hammered, drinks a beer gets hammered! #QandA
If they're arrested and not charged, maybe they shouldn't have been arrested in the first place #qanda

@QandA everyone is carrying some kind of load. Be kinder than necessary
#QandA @qanda Anna Burke there has been alot of talk about our current speakers being bias. Do you have any ideas on how to improve things?

Great human story from Andrew Robb. As a member of govt what policies most reflect solutions to this problem? Some dissonance here #qanda
Most people don't give a damn about supporting those with mental illnesses. Sad truth #qanda
We need to change the "she'll be right" culture in Australia and start battling the problem #qanda
Australia doesn't have a drinking problem, people abuse the privilege ! @QandA
Good to hear Andrew Robb as the authority on Muslim communities. #qanda @QandA
Hopefully it works out for Ethan but with our record on UN recommended rights and responsibilities I'm not too sure. #qanda
Best line I've heard from you, Tony Jones.  *hat*tip*  #QandA

Stopping drug abuse will help lower mental illness levels. #qanda
Andrew Robb what a solid unit. So dignified #qanda
@QandA #qanda almost I tears listening to @AndrewRobbMP depression hurts #beentheredoingit

That said, mad respect to a politician that can handle the public scrutiny despite having depressive tendencies. That's impressive. #qanda
#qanda we need more people to talk openly about mental illness, it is such a tough thing to do.

Flying cars would make this conversation redundant. #qanda
Better make sure healthcare is still universally accessible #QandA
If we know that marijuana leads to mental illness, I wonder how many #qanda lefties would support drug prohibition.
Thank you Andrew Robb, thank you. More discussion, remove stigma! #qanda

@QandA having friends who suffer, it's about support People don't understand it Parents and friends need to be educated not those suffering.

Unfortunately suicide is still taboo and a very tricky subject to approach for the media #qanda
The #mentalhealth sector has been historically fragmented. We need to unite on priorities, AND on the way forward #QandA
Tony, you said the audience asks the questions; that implies not you. #QandA
@kelsojado: "He glamorises alcoholism but he doesn't drink so he's all good." #qanda

#qanda Australians have a tragic distrust of people who don't drink.

Hey @TISM1982 @TISM_Root - Derryn FUCKING #Hinch is on @QandA
#koori and other #aboriginal courts are beneficial for the aboriginal community #qanda @QandA
The hideous menace, depression, needs fearless leaders &amp; real blokes like @AndrewRobbMP to disseminate how doable recovery is #qanda
If the east west link business case stacked up, the Liberals wouldn't have kept it secret #qanda
Initiatives like #mentalas by ABC are great for raising awareness and reducing stigma around mental health. #qanda
Sit down you useluess cunts. #qanda
#qanda Dave Hughes makes perfect sense
I've lost many opportunities from being upfront about my depression, and I wouldn't change a thing #qanda
far out how did they leave this panel all-white knowing how much time would be dedicated to this issue #qanda
#qanda This govt could help remove depression amongst young Australians by supporting same sex marriage and treating everyone equally
National gun laws needed consent &amp; agreement too. It was done in a matter of weeks! #QandA
I admire @AndrewRobbMP  for his honesty about his journey with depression #qanda
That's life, I'm Derryn Hinch #QandA
Fun fact: the guy that asked the East-West Link question created Bjorn Again, an ABBA tribute band. #qanda
Hawke was three decades ago. We've moved on #qanda
No we can't do enough in schools because the funding is inadequate. #qanda Why is it up to the schools? How about stopping the vilification?
#QandA Is it not at all possible he was just in the moment.  I dont suddenly feel like becoming an alco cos the PM skolled beer
Mike Baird said he is coming to get all the jobs in Victoria, so what does a road really matter to 'poor people who don't drive'. #qanda
Our PM was very thirsty over the weekend! #qanda
It is the governments poor structure for funding services that has resulted in fragmented service delivery to people in need #qanda @QandA
Six non Muslims spending the last fifteen minutes talking about Islam and muslims #qanda
Some poor audio guys have just had their eardrums perforated. #qanda
Every time tony says panel, drink! @QandA
Great to hear #depression and #mentalhealth being raised on #QandA. Thanks for sharing your 43 year struggle, @AndrewRobbMP
So will you be impressed by my advocacy for refugees? Our compassion should be heard at any age! #qanda @QandA
White Australians need to take a litmus test. Do they denounce white supremacy? Do they denounce islamophobia? #QandA
The government are doing there best to ramp up fear and then have Andrew Robb complain about fear #Qanda
We're all primitive men and women, howling at the moon, waiting for the miracle that will deliver us from ordinariness. #qanda
Anna Bourke you badass #qanda
The objectives are all fine. Why don't we try to act on them eh? #QandA
Why do people not understand if roads are freed up by people using trains THEY ARE FREED UP FOR BUSINESSES WHO NEED TO USE THEM! #QandA
@QandA #QandA Why was Australia's response to terrorism to elect self proclaimed xenophobe @TonyAbbottMHR as PM?
#QandA the ice epidemic amongst our youth is a much more concerning form of radicalisation that we must address
#qanda Shame that belief in some mythical character is the root of all humankind's problems.
#qanda I also hate the word "tolerant".
So they binge drank but this generation can't?@qanda #qanda
420-blaze it! Who's going to get blazed after the show? #qanda
#QandA How much Botox has Burns had?  Her face moves like she's one of the Thunderbirds.. and she's lecturing on courage??
#mentalillness is not a single diagnosis #QandA
Excellent point from @HumanHeadline - some of the accused from the weekend's terrorist raids are roaming free. Why? #qanda
i was with you there for awhile derryn but fark your rhetoric took a turn for the worse #qanda
Amen to this. #qanda toeing party lines, silencing debate on the #TPP #WhySoSecret @TonyJones_qanda? https://t.co/00rARf0cvw
Re mental health budgets, we shouldn't have to choose between preventative and acute care. We can do both #qanda
I'd rather have the proper NBN over East West link.  #qanda
A few bad apples always spoil the crop #qanda
@QandA alienating 'diverse' people isn't going to help them feel a part of a community. Funnily enough welcoming them does! #qanda
Anna Burke has tapped into the Melbourne market #lightrail #qanda
Hopefully someone asks a question about the TPP. Rob is about to sign away Aust's rights and won't make it public.  #qanda
All of these hypotheticals on solutions do nothing to actually solve Islamophobia #qanda
Michael Phelps was at a private gathering as well when he was caught on cam with a bong load. Nowhere is private for a public figure #qanda
Never thought I'd say #qanda is entertaining... Heckling at its finest
Vegan extremists? I must have missed the reports of terrorist tofu attacks #qanda
A litmus test? We're checking peoples pH levels now? You're  purple!?!?!? Arghhhh!!! #qanda
@BrendanFrankly There is no such thing as responsible use of alcohol. Alcohol is an addictive substance. #QandA
western democracy and capitalism is marginalising 99 percent of all citizens and radicalising many people for many reasons #qanda
Anna Burke, that was just perfect. #qanda
There are many 'normal' Aussies who are a burden to taxpayers also. #qanda
People listen to a voice that speaks to them. Whether or not that voice does any good to humanity is what the issue is here. #qanda
darren you can't just change the topic like that... #qanda
#qanda @QandA why should there be a stigma? There's nothing wrong with not being ok 24/7
@MolksTVTalk @RitaPanahi but this isn't commercial TV public relations. It's #qanda - subject to ABC editorial policies. Fact checking. Etc
Andrew Robb talks about the level of fear of Islamic extremism, I am much more afraid of intolerance. #qanda
Fuck off Hinch, mental health problems existed before ice was an issue. #qanda
When will they be taking a litmus test to show not extremists. #qanda
How could you not be depressed as a member of Howards government? #qanda
We're a laughing stock on the world stage. We trash human rights but criticise others. Disgraceful. #qanda
If Tony didn't down the beer he'd suffer more criticism...@qanda #qanda
Should Australia "get over" the violence, social problems, sexism and health issues that arise from binge drinking? PM can do better #qanda
#qanda skoll skoll skoll!
.@trinest Tony shot himself in the foot with that one. Acknowledging there is a question then ignoring it. Blatant censorship. #qanda
#qanda Hey Derryn Hinch, want to talk about your alcoholism? That needed a liver transplant?
Did Anna Burke think Arthur Stace was an extremist? #qanda
Hang on. Isn't Sinodinos in prison ? You know, corruption, etc #qanda
So why has the LNP govt cut health funding and community counselling services? #qanda
#qanda derrin hinch is right about subtle workplace discrimination against mental illness, despite the rhetoric
Joe Tex in the house! #QandA
please can we make this happen tks RT @oz_f: If one night we all just didn't watch #qanda it's ratings tanked I reckon we'd kill it.
Couldn't it be argued that  Reclaim Australia is an extremists movement? #qanda
Dave throws a truth bomb immediately. You fascists anti-Muslim dumbarses are not special. #qanda
Jane is speaking a lot of sense #qanda
"We used to pride ourselves on being a multicultural, diverse society and if we aren't going to create that we'll create extremism" #qanda
Are the asylum seekers committing suicide in detention centres included in these statistics? @QandA #qanda
#ABC #qanda Cheap shot about alcohol
@cfsmtbation Gave up on #QandA a long time ago. It's a freaking echo chamber
Derryn Hinch is incapable of letting a woman speak wow #qanda
That person yelling should have limited it to 140 characters #QandA
How can this not have bipartisan support #qanda
Everyone is the same when you turn off the light. @QandA
So great to hear some compassion on the program tonight #qanda @QandA
We get the point. You're live from Melbourne tonight. All these references. #yarra #footscray #qanda
Alcohol sponsorship needs to stop #QandA
The microphones have a life of their own tonight #qanda
#qanda Winston Churchill was a binge drinker and he won a World War !!!
A discrete local campaign to deradicalise disaffected can't have a national awareness campaign or the fridge magnets might return #qanda
I turned on the #Qanda live stream because I was told there would be a rowdy audience. I paid my money where is rowdy audience
#qanda More light rail...and not just for Melbourne!!
Government give fear. Schools give hope. #qanda
Why single out Islam when all the monotheistic religions have extremists. #qanda
Getting cars off the road? Sure, but let's fix public transport first. #QandA
The problem lies in ALL extremism! Stop singling out one group! #qanda
I remember your early comedy gigs, Hughesy.  So the depressed stoner act wasn't just an act? #qanda
BUT TERRORISM! #qanda
#qanda #springst
@RitaPanahi @QandA . Dont put yourself through the pain of watching this bunch of purist wankers. It takes a while but you can eventually!
I think that the threat of terrorism is real; but the government is just publicly whipping up fear, and making it a big deal #qanda
Anna Burke as Speaker of the House. Ahh, those were the days #QandA #auspol
Wtaf... that is digusting #qanda
To improve mental health we need to teach our kids to have healthy self esteem.  Good mental health starts with high self esteem #qanda
Take away Tony's canned laughter button #qanda
everyone's makeup is a little heavy tonight  #qanda
The toughest guy in the pub is the one who says 'no thanks I'll be right'. Hughesy - you're a great role model #qanda
I haven't seen Melbournians this vocal, since Wayne Carey #qanda
HAHAHA. #qanda
I'm glad Derryn is physically well, though. #qanda
We need to be proactive. We need early intervention. We need to take action before the worst hits #qanda #NMHCReport
Can we please deport all of our heartless, souless politicians, bureaucrats, and media hacks?  #qanda
The #QandA ignorance begins: Hinch: Halal certification IS the existence of Sharia in Australia. Such ignorance! #auspol
Good point @janeburns. Acceptance of diversity is critical for social cohesion. #qanda #islamophobia
Is it a contest to make the most bizarre comparison? #qanda
Tolerance! #qanda
Brilliant question! #qanda
What is the point of appointing advisory bodies and then not implementing key recommendations? #qanda
#qanda THAT QUESTION YES YES YES. THANK YOU.
Robb got his help. But damn if he's going to help anyone else. #qanda
Deradicalisation is a waste of money, let them go to Syria and get killed instead of keeping them here to inflict an attack #QandA
#qanda Derryn Hinch is a convicted criminal who shows contempt for the law. Why is he given air for his hatred on the ABC?
Another protest on #qanda, this time about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Especially when Napthine agreed to this set up before the election #qanda you tell em Anna!
#qanda Once again it's everyone's fault but the terrorists.
Seems that @tonyjones_qanda is herding cats with his panel tonight. @qanda #qanda
So much lip in the audience #ujcomm2567 #qanda
#QandA the more self obsessed we become the more our mental health deteriorates.
Give the ABC some more money so they can fix the sound! @QandA
@QandA #qanda  why does nobody  call the mosque burning in Toowoomba a terrorist act?
#qanda  https://t.co/JrB3tyFZIe
Diversity can only be celebrated when we all pursue a common outcome, until then we will always have fractions in community. #qanda
Without Tiago Splitter, who on the Spurs is best placed to handle Blake Griffin? #qanda
Hinch just can't get off his hobby horse.  #qanda
How many Buddhist terrorist were arrested on the weekend? #qanda
#qanda I feel there is a connection between mental health and radical extremism
Putting political beliefs aside and listening to Andrew Robb, braver than the man who says no to a drink in the pub  #qanda
@QandA Abbott is NO Bob Hawke!#QandA
Abbott had one beer. He's not an alcoholic. #qanda
@MattGrudnoff @QandA @ABCTV  has a filter for subversive shit like that- under instruction from #abbott #LNP #IPA and #Murdoch! #AUSPOL
You can only blow people up for so long before they decide to fight back. #qanda
Why are there no muslims on the panel? #qanda @QandA
Hope #qanda is quick to issue a retraction - poor form quoting a parody account
We need to help kids from early teens to fight terrible toll of youth suicide #qanda
If #qanda is pushing some buttons Lifeline is available on 13 11 14 @LifelineAust @QandA
Ethan you little legend #qanda
#qanda thank you Andrew Robb. Don't like your politics but great call
Gee, isn't the ABC doing a great job with technology tonight? #qanda
There has to be a happy ending to this, the public have spoken up, thankfully! #qanda
Abbott govt has no idea how to react to any report or review, they are bereft of direction or leadership. Hapless and hopeless. #qanda
Rules Schmules #QandA
Why is Anna Burke not the opposition leader? She's the only Labor member that actually stands for Labor values. #qanda
This is my Bandwagon! #headspace services for my rural community are &gt;100km away, no use for rural kids w/out cars! #qanda
Little bit of medicinal chocolate #qanda
Why not the rage about 700 lives lost at sea yesterday rather then PM beer habits #qanda
Me and my daughter were told the MH team were too busy to come out when she was suicidal #qanda
@AndrewRobbMP Great to hear you speak about #depression in #qanda all the best, look fwd to your book,
Well said, embracing diversity in our society #qanda
If you have a broken arm, a hospital will fix you ASAP, if you have a broken mind, take a number #qanda
It's not PC, but I loved seeing Tones smash the middy. #qanda
It seems like we sometimes grow up and lose the amazing compassion of youth #qanda
Matthew 18:3 #qanda
#qanda irony of an all white panel talking about the need for diversity &amp; inclusion
What the heck is wrong with the bloody government that a disabled kid has to be thrown out of the country! #qanda
Raw truth is if Islam wasn't in Australia there would be no terrorism here #qanda
#qanda capitalism is a global problem also.  They just rip you economic guts out.
Funding local solutions and taking a pro-active rather than reactive approaches to mental illness would be a great initiative #qanda
#qanda Let's have a beer and an onion. The Abbott way!
AND THE CROWD GOES WILD #QandA
#qanda 's Word of the night seems to be #blotto
Good good Hinch rant let the hate flow through you. #qanda
#qanda really went 0-100 in about 3 seconds. Good grief what a horrible show.
Indeed. #qanda  https://t.co/DGkfhSobzr
#qanda #springst  https://t.co/YYtyvYNwmq
#qanda Oh! The horror! The Hallam 'terrorist' is 'connected' to a 14 year-old Brit!
#qanda @QandA there's no shame in seeking help
@DHughesy bringing the realistic view to #qanda
All hatred and marginalisation will breed insurgence #radicalisation #qanda
Remember to balance your drinking with appropriate pauses for raw onions #qanda
Poopfath - sums up the reclaimer attitude ;) #qanda
How come we've has so many terror raids and politicians standing in front of flags since Abbott came to power? #qanda
#qanda 100% correct abt any mental illness &amp; career. Labelled "mad", an outlier, "fith" etc. happens in every occupation.
It's the Tony Jones show....again  #qanda
Snooze fest #QandA
#qanda omg can we please get some intellectual gravitas on the panel - sorry Anna Burke you are a non-starter
Based on facts Access to generic medicines will be hard for those in most need #releasetheTPP #QandA @AndrewRobbMP
#qanda im sorry, seems like we are more passionated abt road crossing than depression?
Any time someone wants to mention the environmental benefits of light rail vs roads for the East - West link that'd be just great... #QandA
Oh Andrew... Abbott said outright he'd only fund roads. #qanda it's not your fight shut up.
Qanda: the show where all the panelists speak at the same time #qanda
High Quality ECEC builds emotionally secure, well adjust chn. This needs to be supported by the govt to be effective! #qanda
Ask #RUOK everyday. How about #RUOK365? #QandA
When migrants come to Aus they integrate. Yet Muslims demand we change for them. Dont like it leave. Dont try and change what's here #qanda
Most people can't just ring Jeff Kennett and access the care they need.  System is broken. #qanda
Is Panahi on #qanda. For fucks sake ABC go straight to Katie Hopkins. Balance. Give up on the theory.
Well said Tony ! #qanda
It's sad to think that people probably just think depression is their personality &amp; don't realise, so good to hear triggers #qanda
Creeping sharia...  Stop the drinks  #qanda
Thank goodness, social cohesion in the air at last. #qanda
Mary Shelley's Human Headlinestein. #qanda
Muslims can apologise for terrorists when Christians apologise for the KKK or the Westboro Church or the Paedophile priests #QandA
Drug addiction, an enormous issue for Australia. Agree with Derryn. #qanda
#QandA Let's face it, the only thing the East-West Link is fast-tracking is #obesity, sedentary lifestyles and non-communicable diseases
It's a sad day when our PM can't skull one beer #qanda
@QandA so true !! It is a national tragedy!!7 people a day !!
It's also manly to not drink #qanda
Great to see an open discussion about depression! #QandA
#suicide is as preventable as car accidents &amp; skincancer. But where is the 'slip, slip, slap' campaign for #suicide? #qanda
#qanda @QandA So you need to be a squeaky wheel.
Andrew Robb now tells Muslim leaders to take control of "their" community #qanda
#QandA FFS. It's a very major report after sooo many very major reports. People are killing themselves. Families are breaking.
#qanda just think how far the money that's being wasted keeping the asylum seeker policy afloat would go towards promoting mental health
@cathywilcox1 @QandA showing my age....
Oh geez it's just one bloody beer, people.  Lighten up #qanda
When will people start waking up?#qanda @qanda
Andrew Robb is getting demolished. #qanda
Andrew Robb is a deeply uncharismatic man #qanda
Trains good, planes bad! #noagenda #qanda
maybe Tony  just felt like cold beer! #QandA
The Federal government believes the only role for them is to find big profits for infrastructure builds that create private profit. #qanda
Andrew Robb in his defence of roads is actually making the argument for public transport #QandA
Admitting we have a mental health issue the first step in recovery @QandA
Call me a shill but I like it when people actually explain.. let the man finish! #QandA
@FroudeyBrand Stop being stupid. We have one planet and one humanity. #qanda Let's look after everyone who needs it.
"The department has a set of rules and the first one is that we do not practice compassion or basic decency" #qanda
Islamic extremists are killing Christians &amp; Anna Burke says the victims are Muslim girls afraid to wear headscarfs! Really? #qanda
Sydney got rid of its rail crossings decades ago, what's up with you Melbourne? #qanda
#qanda Attempts to make excuses for terrorism are frankly nauseating.
Get the government to pay for funerals of suicides, pretty soon preventative action will be taken #QandA
Medication...should be the last resorts. All too often, utter poison. #qanda
#QandA @QandA @HumanHeadline for PM
@__Miss_Sarah__ @daveyk317 @QandA actually we dont. Its a perception not a fact. Get off high horse
This discussion is destroying my will to stay awake. #qanda
We're all individuals @DHughesy #qanda
Cost benefit ratio for EW Link (dollars of public benefit returned for dollars  spent) was 45 cents returned for each $1 #qanda

@QandA Andrew Robb thank you for sharing and being truthful.
alcohol is NOT the problem! try councils &amp; state governments who grant 240 liqueur licenses in 300m, try Fitzroy st stkilda @QandA #auspol
Perhaps Andrew Robb might go live in the USA. #qanda
Alarming statistics on our mental health in Aust. with 7 people a day committing suicide. Preventative health is a must. #qanda
7 suicides a day but they want us to believe terrorism is the bigger threat. #qanda
I wonder if Anna Burke will shout, "Order!" An interesting panel. #qanda
MONORAIL. MONORAIL. THE MOB HAS SPOKEN #qanda
Did the tweet selector fall asleep? Where's the feed? #qanda
The way we treat asylum seekers is no example to young people from any background. #qanda
@LordAzFromOz Start one. I was being deliberately extreme to point out absurdity of question on qanda btw.
How much policy has been negotiated over a drink? #QandA
Why isn't Alan Jones behind bars for inciting hatred? #qanda
@calscran I prefer cat piss to get high #qanda
99.99% of muslems reject jihad #QandA

The Liberal love fest can't see the trees for the woods on value of #MelbourneMetro over #EastWestLink. Grow a brain people. #QandA
Depressed ppl must reach out to Dr &amp; ask for help before they can refer to psychologist. Medics must be better at spotting the signs #qanda
Ask Robb about the #TPP which effects us all.. What's in it for us? @QandA
Visited London recently. Never waited more than 2 minutes for a train. Make of that what you will. #qanda
How long till they start blaming the youth for it? #qanda
What an outrageous thing 4 @AndrewRobbMP to say on #qanda that the EWL was scrapped because the @CFMEU_National doesn't have control over it
RedScareBot: Exit stage left RT riotbookshelf Bloody Greens and their bloody communist public transport! Where will it end? #qanda
You're telling me #QandA couldn't find a single Muslim for this panel discussing Muslim extremism? #auspol
Special Magistrate Hinch? "Fixing" the legal system one brash and uninformed statement at a time #QandA
I escaped hearing Dave Hughes during the @micomfestival. And now this. #qanda
Brain damage is not mental illness Derryn #qanda
Hughes equals snooze #qanda
#QandA A litmus test for Muslims, do you support a caliphate? Most Muslims don't even know what a caliphate is!! Nonsense question!
The panel is talking positive and yet still just highlighting the epidemic racism in Australia #QandA
Australia has a drinking culture &amp; Abbott has done nothing to change this #QandA
Bob Hawke gave up drinking before he was Prime Minister. #qanda
The PM used to be good on the red too #QandA
Apparently the #Victoria state boundary is at Coburg. #qanda Melbournites have no idea. It's a mini New York.
Waiting for Anna Burke to yell out "Order!" if the panel stops listening to Tony. @QandA #QandA
Depression is not the flu! #QandA
@janeburns speaking beautifully about government working together as partnerships to educate about depression and reduce stigma on QandA
Notice noone else around her is drinking? #qanda https://t.co/vzzvtmRJn4

You know this country has a future with kids like Ethan! #qanda
#qanda David Hughes is living in la la land.
If it takes Robb this long to even summarise the current report status, what does this say about their pace of response? #qanda
Can Tony shirt front depression? #QandA
If you want to destroy the ice epidemic, perhaps we should start discussing the legalisation of soft drugs. #qanda
Fuck off Twitter second worst thing after #qanda itself is gotcha Twitter
#qanda Define 'one day'
Ol' Mr. Hinch speaking the bearded truth! #qanda
Dave Hughes being on #qanda makes me die a little inside. What possible informed insight could that twat offer?
#qanda Mental health needs far more support from governments because it affects so many young people
Some rules need to be broken #qanda
Love that depression is being spoken about on #QandA. Hopefully it will start to breakdown the stigma &amp; encourage leaders to effect change
Break the stigma, tell your Boss, tell the world.....it's just an illness #qanda
I am, however, open to more talk about man-dates (especially if they involve cute nerds). #qanda
@thevintagebaker @AndrewRobbMP @QandA thank you!
I can tell you why Abbott has discounted it. Because Gillard tried to set up local community health centres and Abbott killed them #qanda
Maybe, just maybe Shane Warne is a dullard? #qanda
. @beyondblue @DHughesy you are a #deadsetlegend sharing your story about mental health and depression #qanda @QandA
"More companies might want to work with Victoria because they'll get $500m for doing nothing" - @DHughesy #qanda
Hughes ought to have a word to Tony Abbott. A tough man is one who says "No thanks" to another beer. #qanda
Maybe we need to try no religion - Imagine that world  #qanda
Good that we talking about #mentalhealth and #depression on #qanda but let's turn to how poor ppl get help with no money and cut services?
#qanda #alcohol The fact we think it is so un-australian to question Alcohol proves the problem.
Everything the PM does is planned. #qanda
#qanda The Budget... how much of our tax dollars go to Arms Trade Advertising? Remembering why many war$ take place. https://t.co/gYSkGd5vEc

Well, that was fun! #qanda
I was gonna clip my toenails but I'm too angry now and that could result in injury #QandA
Legalise suicide. Make it a process. It could be the step that prevents it. #qanda
Probably should do the right thing here Andrew. #qanda
Pretty silly question #qanda
Put a rail to the airport!# qanda
What about suicides in remote Indigenous communities where the rate is 6 times more than the rest of Australia #qanda
Can't we all just get along (without deporting harmless kids)? #qanda
We need a better mental health system to give people the best treatment #qanda
The health system let her daughter down because she became an ice addict? Oh-kay. #qanda
Doesn't a litmus test tell you where something is on a spectrum? It's hardly black and white. #qanda
get your shit together Mod #qanda
@QandA All religions and isms are problems. Their life's blood is difference and division. The only ism we need is humanitarianism.
@maddiekelly94: #qanda Ethan, thank you for your voice. You set an example for many adults who lack your maturity and empathy.
Sure let's whitewash the Muslim issues, yet again #qanda
#BlackLivesMatter #qanda  https://t.co/fGYUyyEnr6
@QandA @AndrewRobbMP  Basic counselling, no limit to number of sessions, early psychiatrist, good inpatient support needed in ACT
The comments and double standards placed on Tony Abbott is beyond a joke..  #qanda
People with autism are not a burden. @QandA #QandA
So think of the Bridge likes Tony's version of NBN. Won't work! #QandA
They NEED to get REAL on mental health - keeping GOOD psychs in public health, otherwise you see diff doc every time #nopoint #QandA
Turn of #qanda and relax with my #MKR recap http://t.co/MTFlgNfbXD
Abbott has caused immeasurable damage to Aus. Daniel Andrews is a small fish in comparison. #qanda
#qanda Not an ounce of empathy from Robb.Just him.
That noise sounds like a dentist gouging at my teeth #qanda
@QandA Dave Hughes you are one of the lucky ones to have a supportive mum. i just wish everyone was that lucky.
Yes you can take your 3 kids on public transport. People do it all the time. #qanda

Watching #qanda for the first time and I can't help but notice that the only two ladies on the panel are getting very little speaking time.
nice to a have a even panel on musilim relations #QandA #irony #whereswaleedwhenyouneedhim
Way to spoil the beginning of #qanda
Next subject piss off Robb #qanda
Fuck I'm good. A tweet on #qanda http://t.co/fJT1g02HM9
#qanda Human Headline to the point and the way we need to speak about issues.
@qanda #qanda after the onion incident, nothing about Abbott is too surprising
Roads fill as fast as you build them. Public transport is priority #qanda
#qanda Give us a break, the healthiest PM that ever was rides 50km a day, move on.
We've moved on from the Bob Hawke era. This blokey stuff from the PM for Women is gross. #qanda
Go Anna, reality check for voters: Vic Libs f#%ed you over. #qanda
@DerrynHinch worrying one has to censor themselves in a democracy or else face jail time. Your outspokenness is very welcome #qanda
When you have a depressive episode there is nothing better than your doc telling you "you will get better" #qanda
Our cities will come to a halt if we don't invest in this war against drugs QandA
When it comes to others religion/culture, acceptance should be a given, but how about support too? #qanda #ujcomm2657 @QandA
If roads are not the priority. Then build the VFT between Melbourne and Sydney #qanda
Disability as an excuse to deport?! Disgusting. @QandA
Annnnd just like we go from one of the most important issues within Australia...into tax issues....argh!!! #QandA
Simply but very well put hughsey! @QandA #qanda
We don't have de-radicalisation programs cause we can afford a Climate Change denier but not remote aboriginal communities. #qanda
Victorian Labor keeps its promises unlike the Federal Liberals #QandA
#QandA ha! Port Pirie I was the for about 3 weeks once.
Derryn Hinch weighs over 140kg's ! Keep it up big boy :) #qanda
I bet the other politics have had a beer or two, so why not the PM ? #qanda
Shit, hey? Pass me a beer. #QandA
#qanda. Can someone calm this labor MP down? Give her a drink!
Andrew Robb's a solid citizen #qanda
The only reason roads are now a federal issue is because of the "political donations" made by the (oil) mining industry #qanda
Derryn Hinch Terra Nullus already. You haven't changed then #qanda @QandA
2.5% money for 10 fucken years. You reckon federal govt will load up on it to build infrastructure with a much greater return ? Nope #qanda
@AndrewRobbMP Dead right. Stigma still exists around mental illness #qanda
as much as I don't like the Libs,Andrew Robb's open dialogue around depression is admirable. Depression is a tough one.#props, #qanda
heartbreaking #qanda
Beer is pretty nice.  #qanda
The worst thing about #qanda has to be the nonsense answers given by token celebrities who have no idea what they're talking about.
'im just like you guys, i love beer and the boys' - tony #qanda
TPP??  #QandA
#QandA @QandA Reports and reviews are not action
#qanda sharing the personal burden lightens the load, that's for sure.
This review is from industry experts and yet our politicians are the ones completely disregarding the recommendations! #qanda what?!
@TheKateWall totally agree. Parents are arguably the most influential teachers of value #qanda
@QandA this started with the Richmond Report. They took it and screwed it up. DON'T DO IT AGAIN
Heavy rail moves more people than any road ever will #qanda
Sydney's Shia Mosque in Arncliffe exists peacefully with Orthodox &amp; Catholic neighbours ... Salafist jihadism does not want peace #qanda
Having to wait for every 3rd/4th bus to get to the station because I use a wheelchair is a joke. #QandA
WHY HAVE THE #QANDA PANEL GOT Q-TIPS GLUED TO THEIR FACES? IS THIS THE CREEPING HAND OF BIG PHARMA SPONSORSHIP AT WORK??
Of course the issue is a Premiere not wanting to unduly blame a whole community for an extreme few,  Hinch is fool #qanda
#qanda Yes Derrick Ice Bad but so are allthe other drugsDrugs are doing to Australia what we are all scared Terrorists will do wipe kids out
How we build on the capacity of communities to respond  #NMHCReport #mentalhealth #qanda @janeburns
Brining up the Lindt cafe dude like he is relevant. Come one now. We can do better. #qanda
Medicare only funds 6 sessions a year as standard for psych visits. Barely more than a month or 2 of support. Not enough #qanda
Still piss poor access via roads to the CBD from the north western burbs #qanda
Dont just make it about individuals &amp; their mental health - compassion as a prime social value will maximise the wellbeing of all #QandA
Mental health got allot worse when lefties started telling lies about climate change #QandA
They should issue rotten tomatoes to the audience in the way in. #qanda
#qanda Robb fuck frightening
#QandA Progress... BOO!!!!
We spend all this time blaming everything and everyone and no time on solutions #qanda
Victorians fighting...over Victorian things...on a National show...can we move on already please #QandA
If someone told me I had to take a litmus test because of my religion, I'd feel a tad singled out.... #Qanda @QandA
Islam, Islam, Islam...Abbott skolling beer...no questions about the #TPP... #qanda
I will not watch #qanda. I will not watch #qanda. I will not watch #qanda. I will not watch #qanda. I will not watch #qanda. I will not.
Interesting to hear how someone combats depression #qanda
A lot of great people in this world did and still do have depression #qanda
#qanda private enterprise won't  take government money? Yeah right!
This needs attention, leadership &amp; action above and beyond Abbott's pub antics. http://t.co/TA9lhZRizL #qanda https://t.co/1nUlM7kLcC
Good to see Jones stopped the TPP questions being asked #qanda
Time to set a new vision for #mentalhealth in Australia. Prevention must be part of that vision #qanda #NMHCReport http://t.co/Kg4R61g0fj
Unfortunately, we can't disclose mental health issues in workplace for discrimination. But Andrew talking may help change this #qanda
#qanda We are one race, the human race.
Great story from Andrew Robb. What a  horrifying story with a good ending. #qanda
God help any vulnerable or disadvantaged person who has to rely on the discretion of Peter Dutton. #qanda
#QandA It is the adults/learder who are providing the fear. The children don't invent it.
@QandA # what cost a life?
#qanda the PM is a volunteer life saver, he had a bee with the boys what's wrong with that http://t.co/cpzTGTMqJz
We need to also let people be okay with helping themselves not just 'fixing' them #qanda #mentalillness
Wow group male interrupting of a female who has hardly spoken at all yet. #qanda
Talking about mental health is the best weapon we have to break down the stigma that surrounds it #QandA
We need to stop these children from joining radical death cults. Now eat your body of Christ. #QandA
As an Irishman.... I think we should all go for a pint and talk shit about hedonism. #QandA
Good work, Andrew Robb #qanda
@QandA So why are the Canberra Liberals threatening to cancel a light rail contract entered into by the current Labor government?
Anna Burke is right. The money has been spent #qanda
Welcome to Australia only if your able bodied, bloody hell! #qanda
#qanda Look at the third world countries than look around U ! You'll feel better !!
*taps out* I'm done. Qanda ban has been reinstated.
Dave Hughes giving up alcohol. Worth a toast.  #QandA
@QandA absolutely stupid question. Elections been run &amp; won.
Bloody hell! How many kids in detention desperate enough to attempt suicide &amp; Govt claimed it was blackmail! #QandA
Self-Denial is the BIGGEST cause of mental illness in Australia #QandA #AusPol
He swims a whole lot I think. #QandA
#QandA   Many politicians become depressed when losing elections or leadership positions like Kennett
A mental illness is something you have. It isn't who you are. It needs to be accepted with out shame,just like having asthma. #qanda
Despicable behaviour on the part of the government! #qanda
The problem is not attached to any organization.  #qanda
People shouldn't be isolated from society due to religion #qanda
Anna Burke, our "great fabric" is being destroyed - but by the 'leaders'.&amp; your previous leader reprised the rot. #qanda
Where's the thought of local councils invest in education and diversity.Only activities are Christmas carols #QandA namaste for example
@QandA https://t.co/ss4MxSENGU
Can't take kids on public transport? Tell that to the thousands of kids and parents who rely on public transport everyday? #qanda
Thanks to the Coalition for many years of dogwhistling racists. This is the result #qanda
Andrew Robb worried about these "mad men" who want to declare war on the rest of the world, like these guys? http://t.co/JerIiQzfV8 #QandA
The Department has rules. They are wrong, and discrimatory #qanda
@Lahmy88 @QandA None taken ^_^
@qanda Dave, it's called the dominant culture
Surely as a nation we're intelligent enough not to tar everyone with the same brush? #QandA
Ethan, hope for the future, Empathy Rocks #qanda
The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance. - Nathaniel Branden #QandA #depression #mentalhealth
Great comment from @DHughesy. The toughest guy in the pub is the one that says 'nah, I'm right' #qanda
@MotherofOpinion @LaLegale @JaneCaro @QandA you have 4
Cmon, lets get onto a real question now... #QandA
Webster's defines a contract as an agreement by law which is unbreakable, which is unbreakable #Simpsons #qanda
@QandA #QandA It's only bad to skull a beer if you're a sitting PM. Hawky did it 60 years ago and at the cricket only a couple of years ago!
@QandA Tony "Moral Panic" Abbot promotes fear of the other
Anyone else suddenly really keen on a beer? #qanda
I suffered from depression once. It lasted an hour, and coincided with sitting through a Clementi piano recital #qanda #yolo #mozart
That's life, and I'm Derryn Hinch #QandA
Australia doesn't have a drinking culture. Australia has a drinking problem #qanda
#Qanda Yeah thanks Dave. I thought I was psychotic. Maybe I should stop taking acid.
The tradie can still drive his ladder to work on freed-up roads when most of those carrying suitcases are on public transport.  #qanda
the toughest guy in the bar is me, rebecca #qanda
Put it on a bloody tshirt, some idiot media mouth piece or politicians call for all Muslims to reject terrorism, it's moronic #qanda
Do any of them experts on town planning? #qanda
@qanda @DHughesy &amp; @HumanHeadline the 2 DH's together , OMG #livingthedream
First thing we do is recognize we have a problem with cross-cultural interaction in Australia. We pretend we are so welcoming. #qanda
We need to hear more from people like @AndrewRobbMP- their stories told in the public arena will break the stigma cycle #QandA #ujcomm2657
Andrews campaigned on not building this road. The majority voter labor. So. Shut up Hinch. #qanda
Poor people don't drive #qanda
Discussion of Mental Health amongst men is still left relatively untouched. Good to hear this stuff on #qanda
Started making an effort to ask people R U OK and it can make a difference - show your friends &amp; colleagues you're listening #qanda
Litmus test shitmus test #racism #qanda @QandA
I was at Port Arthur in 1995.... that was a real threat. #qanda
Australian muslims owe you nothing mate #QandA
Man. Go Ethan. Kids speak the truth. #qanda
When vegans resort to using violence then they just break the very principal they adhere to #qanda
#qanda rumour has it Andrew Robb is a Bullet Train fan? Let's hope so... #auspol
Every time a member of the public suggests that the Muslim leaders need to condemn an attack it suggests that they don't.  #qanda
Everyone's heart is the same #qanda
Light Rail, listen to the Greenies working themselves into a Latte Lather #qanda #auspol
Anna Burke looks thoroughly unconvinced by Andrew Robb with his political spin engaged. So am I. #qanda
@qanda
FFS, this guys a fucking moron. #qanda
What about the mental health of those in prison on Nauru or Manus Island that just wanted a better life #qanda
If you want to see a drinking culture out of control, go out in the UK on a Saturday night #QandA
Good on you Ethan!!! We should not deport this boy! #qanda
Discussions rambling and a dog's breakfast tonight! Rein it in Tony, important topics! #qanda
Should Andrew Robb be mentioning the number of active ASIO investigations? #QandA
Does Beyond Blue service the homeless? #qanda
Both sides have made serious errors in this case. #qanda
@prof_gt the great thing about #qanda is that you can comment on it without even watching, which is what I'm doing.
Acceptance of diversity. Woohoo! The voice of reason from Jane Burns. #qanda
#qanda Abbott's publicity stunts are more and more like North Korea's  KimJong un.
Kevin Rudd's strip club trip helped his popularity Scores. #qanda
Reclaim Australia is John Howard's most visible legacy #qanda
#QandA wrong young people are committing suicide due to drug use not depression, it is a fact
"There are 400 ASIO priority investigations going on at the moment." Let's talk about the word "priority", Andrew. #qanda
YOUNG LIBERAL ALERT! #qanda
#TonyAbbottDrinkingGames: Stop The Schooners #qanda
Social cohesion and supporting  youth voice enables connectedness and participation #qanda
Yay kid! #QandA
Hughesy calling Derryn Hinch a wanker- probably should have expected it but still caught me by surprised #QandA #ujcomm2657
#QandA A good start would be not stereotyping
Cause of depression and mental health issues- exploitative economic system the #tpp #qanda
This #qanda panel is as about as nuanced and interesting as Jane Burns expressionless, botoxed face. Blah, blah, blah.
If you want the money, lay out your plans in DETAIL! A "fragmented sector" sounds dysfunctional and not harmonised. #qanda
Crowds getting a bit restless on #QandA #ujcomm2657
#QandA talking about Islam and resolving nothing. We should be blowing up about this being the public broadcaster #boring #wasteofmoney
It would be nice if there was education in schools against extremism, racism and violence. #qanda
Children understand basic human decency and rights more than old white men in power #QandA
Alcoholism is bi-partisan. #QandA
I wonder how many people have tried while we have been talking on #qanda and not actually doing anything
Will Derryn Hinch say "shame, shame, shame"? #qanda
time for a warnie on the rocks, it's 5 o'clock somewhere #qanda
I love how open @DHughesy is about his issues &amp; how he concourred them Thanks Dave for showing young people how to seek help #QandA
Oh sod off Derryn Hinch #qanda
#qanda ko
#qanda I happily gave up drinking 12 years ago. I'm not dependent on grog to make me happy !
@lovethatloaf Its no longer the ABC its the IPA/ LNP broadcasting commisson. Disgusted by the lack of accountablity #auspol #ausvotes #QandA
Well done Andrew. You're human and seem so much more approachable as a politician #qanda
@QandA what is a litmus test? DNA? English? White skin? Conversion to Christianity? #qanda
#qanda panel keeps saying the solution is "leadership" but it's a weasel word meaning "I have nothing".
#QandA its once again an education thing. Have a drink but dont be an idiot
@QandA fix crossing first --
Who cares about discretion? Discrimination shouldn't be ingrained in the system in the first place! #qanda
Geez. What a crappy first question. What is litmus anyway? #qanda
@pfh007 seriously?! Nobody cares? Nobody has heard of TPP? They are talking such sh#t #qanda ice? Ice? F#cking jailbird
"Lets focus on youth leadership, building social cohesion and acceptance of diversity" says @janeburns  #qanda #yawrc
lmao thought you'd get away from my qanda spam tonight yoU thought wrong
#qanda Honestly who has lived a few decades on this earth and not suffered anxiety and depression?
@RitaPanahi @QandA playing the victim?
#qanda so proud of anyone that starts the conversation around #mentalillness #conversationsmatter worthy narratives!
When did #qanda become a health, social issue program - politics and economics too difficult?
@QandA bloke had a beer. Nothing to see here #qanda
#qanda Derryn that was 1972, thinkgs have changed
We need to shred duplication. #Justsayin #QandA
Anna Burke talking sense which is what she does best.  #QandA
Anzac Day leaves Warny for dead - he wasn't promoting alcohol after a dawn service but after the 6 week World Cup! #qanda
#qanda headspace has saved young lives! It needs more resources to what it has. Youth suicide each week in ACT. This must be a priority!
Preventing people from entering psychiatric hospitals with community based care is far cheaper and more effective than hospital care #qanda
This #qanda is rubbish...
Which orifice does the litmus strip get inserted into for this test? #QandA
#qanda let's see Rob squirm his way out of this...prick.
Pretty sad when a PM succumbs to peer pressure. #qanda
We struggle with Online grooming, stalking, scams... Online-radicalisation isnt much different; enforcement is only part of it #qanda
Sitting here skolling beers....damn, now I have a hankering for onions #qanda
Talking about #mentalillness to break down stigma starts in schools, communities and workplaces #qanda @janeburns @beyondblue
Moderate Muslims need to start a reformation of their church, Luther style #qanda
If the PM has a drink, he's irresponsible. If the PM doesn't have a drink, he's a wowser. It's a win-win for the ABC #qanda
Being a massive boozer is the real litmus test for being a true Aussie. #qanda

@qanda Dr Karl has withdrawn his support for the IG Report. Why has the government continued using advertisements they asked him to record?
East West Link was the the central issue of the Vic campaign. It was a referendum and the issue was resolved in the negative. #qanda
Why do they want to keep tax dollars for their rich mates who get millions of $ of taxpayer $? The LNP way. #qanda
But what will we do about all the ice addicts on the public transport. #bloodymess #qanda
The minister needs to have a chat to Ethan #qanda
Punctuation is your friend #qanda
Go fuck yourself @AndrewRobbMP. Fuckwit. What a bunch of shit #qanda
The LNP should spend more money on the arts. It really is important in addressing mental health issues in this country. #qanda
Maate. Everyone in the late 1970s skulled schooners + jugs of beers.. #qanda the PM drank a shandy to say it was not a real beer! SHANDY!!
Women not just men have mental health issues #qanda
Derryn Hinch, we do NOT want an #EWLink #qanda
Why does this old guy keep referencing Germany and his trips there #qanda
Jesus. He asked the wrong politician that question. Burke knows her shit. #qanda
Mental illness is not a lifestyle choice...like infertility.  #QandA
Only a man can scull a beer. #qanda
The man can't even drink without stirring a debate about whether his actions are politically correct. Is this even politics? #qanda
Aren't we all high and mighty in the audience tonight. Come back when you have experienced life and stop looking down at everybody #QandA
#qanda @qanda Compare Tony Abbott to Borris Yeltson, I think Tony is fine.
Depression kills more people than terrorists in Australia.  #QandA
But @AndrewRobbMP you're not helping, instead you're dog whistling. Shame on you. #QandA
Why can't chaplain program funds in schools be redirected to mental health services?  #qanda
Why do children put us all the shame #qanda
#qanda I saw a lot of nazi tattoos in the reclaim Australia crowd -
Given the best advice on mental health is for people to talk to their GP maybe it was a really bad idea to put a co-payment on visits #qanda
Drink responsibly. A message from the PM #qanda http://t.co/AsR0j9B2FY

Can we talk about men terrorising women? Yeah. No? #qanda
Candid &amp; refreshing synopsis of mental health in men by Andrew Robb. Good on him. #QandA
Derryn tends to go a bit off topic, probably to talk about something he had a clue about #QandA
@QandA Jackie Lambie is pretty special
The only way to stop the east/west congestion is to get cars off the road! Trams not toll roads! #qanda
Preach it Anna #QandA
If this discussion about depression is bringing up any issues for you the number for @LifelineAust is 13 11 14 #QandA @QandA #ujcomm2657
We need more people in leadership to speak out about how they stay mentally healthy #QandA
